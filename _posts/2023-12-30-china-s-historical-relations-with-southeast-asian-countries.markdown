### Growing Influence through Trade
China has long maintained close economic ties with its Southeast Asian neighbors through trade. As the Thai individual notes, China trades extensively with countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, significantly improving diplomatic relations. **Cross-border commerce** and **foreign direct investment** have allowed China to gain economic influence without direct political control. Governed by an approach of peaceful cooperation, China addresses other nations' concerns through diplomacy rather than military force.

### Resistance to Colonial Domination
Historical records show China launched limited military campaigns into Southeast Asia but faced resistance from indigenous populations wanting to govern themselves. The Qing dynasty sent small armies to Burma and Vietnam in the past, as noted, but both efforts ended in defeat as **local resistance movements** opposed foreign domination. Neighboring ethnic groups like the Khmer and Lao maintained distinct cultural identities and did not welcome Chinese rule, as seen by their opposition to later Vietnamese influence. Most nations preferred independence over becoming subjects of another empire.
### Avoiding Territorial Disputes 
China has long dealt diplomatically with separatist issues in Tibet and Xinjiang to avoid conflict over disputed lands. The individual observes China would not benefit from forcibly annexing neighboring territories given existing border conflicts. Holding additional lands against the will of indigenous peoples would likely spark **long-term instability** and fuel armed rebellions, as occurred under the brutal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Pursuing nonviolent relationships through commerce allows China to access Southeast Asian resources with fewer risks of insurgency or civil unrest within occupied regions.  
### A History of Limited Ambition
As the bilingual inscription from 1336 demonstrates, historical documentation shows China launched small-scale military operations into Southeast Asia but with little intention of permanent conquest or colonial domination. The king of Vietnam's failed campaign against emerging Lan Xang, today's Laos, faced obstacles as the "perverse" local leader fled rather than submit to foreign rule. Throughout its imperial past, available evidence suggests China exhibited **strategic restraint** and did not pursue aggressive imperial expansionism into mainland Southeast Asia on a large scale. Territorial ambitions remained modest compared to later European colonial empires.
### Mutual Benefits of Non-Intervention
Just as the USA avoids annexing neighbors like Mexico and Canada, direct Chinese control over Southeast Asian states would undermine stability without clear benefits. As the Thai individual insightfully notes, China already gains economic access through commerce without political headaches. Given longstanding cultural differences between ethnic groups, populations may resist Chinese governance as violently as they opposed prior Vietnamese influence. Pursuing positive relations through mutually beneficial **trade partnerships** allows China to further its interests peacefully without destabilizing the region through unwanted interventionism. 
### Pursuit of Soft Power Over Hard Power    
Looking to the future, fostering goodwill remains preferable to flexing hard power muscles. While concerns remain regarding Chinese activities in the South China Sea, Beijing generally utilizes "soft power" means like infrastructure investment and cultural exchange through Confucius Institutes to expand influence. This approach aligns with China's historical preference for non-military diplomacy and cooperation. As Southeast Asian nations continue developing robustly within a multi-polar world, renewed great power rivalry appears unnecessary if all sides respect one another's sovereignty and right to self-determination. Open commerce and friendship can better serve Asia's progress than unchecked domination or conflict.
