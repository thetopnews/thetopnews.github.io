### Part 1: Pairing Via Bluetooth
Bluetooth pairing is the easiest way to connect your DualShock 4 controller to your PlayStation 4 console wirelessly. Follow these simple steps to **pair your PS4 controller via Bluetooth:**
Press and hold the PS button and the Share button simultaneously for around 5 seconds until the light bar on the top of the controller starts flashing blue, indicating it is in pairing mode. Go to the "Devices" section of your PS4's settings menu and select "Bluetooth Devices." Your controller should appear in the list of available devices - select it to initiate the pairing process. Once paired, the light bar will remain solid blue. You can now use your controller from a distance of up to 33 feet away without any wires!

### Part 2: Connecting Via USB Cable  
For a wired connection, you can plug your DualShock 4 directly into your PS4 console using the USB charging cable that came in the box. Here is how to **sync your controller via USB:**
Take the smaller end of the USB charging cable and insert it into one of the two front USB ports on your PlayStation 4 console. Plug the other end into the micro USB port located on the bottom center of the DualShock 4 controller. Once plugged in, press and hold the PS button on the controller - it should sync up and connect to your console in a matter of seconds. The light bar will illuminate solid blue to indicate a successful wired connection.
### Part 3: Resolving Multiple Controller Connection Issues
Having issues connecting your controller even after following the pairing steps? It's possible another controller is preventing it from syncing properly. Here are some tips to **resolve multiple controller connection problems:**
If you already have another DualShock 4 controller paired and active, power it down or remove it from the pairing list first. The PS4 can only maintain an active connection with one controller at a time over Bluetooth. Also check that your controller is fully charged - a low battery might disrupt the pairing signal. Fully recharge it before retrying the connection process.
### Part 4: Enabling Wireless Charging Via Bluetooth  
Once paired via Bluetooth, you can **wirelessly charge your DualShock 4 controller** right from your PS4 without any cables:
Go to "Devices" then "Controllers" in your PS4's settings. Select "Bluetooth" as the preferred communication method instead of using a USB cable. Return to the Bluetooth devices list - your paired controller should now show a green dot next to it indicating a stable wireless connection. Place the controller onto your PS4's charging cradle or other Qi-compatible wireless charging pad. It will now charge contactless through the Bluetooth signal.
### Part 5: Troubleshooting Charging Issues
If your controller stops charging or the charging status light won't illuminate, there may be an issue preventing a stable power transfer. Here are some ways to **troubleshoot DualShock 4 charging problems:** 
First, try using a different USB cable and power adapter to rule out any faults. Completely remove the controller from the PS4's Bluetooth list on both devices, then re-pair to establish a fresh connection. Also check for any messages indicating too many controllers may be connected - disconnecting extras could help. Lastly, perform a full reboot of both your console and controller.
### Part 6: Alternative Wireless Charging Methods
While the PS4's charging station is convenient, there are other great **wireless charging options for DualShock 4 controllers** to keep them juiced up anywhere:
Many flagship Samsung and Android smartphones now support **Qi wireless charging standard**. Plugging one of these fast chargers into an outlet and connecting the included USB-C cable to your controller allows contactless powering up. Dedicated charging stands designed for DualShock 4s are also available, such as the Charger Kit from PowerA. Simply place the controller on the base to begin inductive charging from any AC power source.
### Part 7: Contacting PlayStation Support
If you've exhausted all the troubleshooting tips above and are still having issues connecting or charging your PlayStation 4 controller, your last resort is to reach out to PlayStation's support teams. Here are the key ways to **contact PlayStation support** for further assistance:
The top way is through live chat or phone support available on the PlayStation website during business hours. Make sure to have your console and controller serial numbers handy. You can also explore the extensive online support database, connect with communities on forums like Reddit, or open a service request ticket providing details of the problem. PlayStation support representatives are trained to properly diagnose hardware faults - they may recommend sending the controller in for inspection and repair if needed.
I hope these detailed tips help you get your DualShock 4 controller connected, charged and working seamlessly with your PlayStation 4! Let me know if you have any other questions.
