### What is Port Forwarding?

Port forwarding allows incoming network connections to be redirected from your router to a specific device on your home network based on the port. When properly configured, it allows a server running on your local network to be accessible from the wider Internet. However, it does expose your network to potential risks. 

Port forwarding routes traffic sent to a specific port on the router's public IP address to a private computer or device on the local network. This allows that private computer to be accessible from the wider internet by directing the traffic to it. For example, port forwarding port 25565 allows remote connection to a Minecraft server running on that computer.

### Potential Security Risks of Port Forwarding

Port forwarding opens ports that would otherwise be closed, creating potential entry points for hackers. Anyone able to scan open ports could find the forwarded port and attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities. A cybercriminal with access to hacker tools could potentially scan for exposed ports and try to exploit known vulnerabilities to gain entry. It also exposes your public IP address. While not directly hackable through a server, links or replaced server files could potentially allow malicious access.

### Best Practices for Securing a Forwarded Port

Some tips to minimize security risks include using strong unique passwords of at least 12 characters combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. Software should always be kept fully updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Enabling firewalls provides an additional layer of protection by only allowing connections to forwarded ports while blocking all others. Forwarded ports should be limited only to the minimum needed and whitelisting trusted users limits remote access. Monitoring router logs regularly checks for suspicious activity.

### Alternative Connection Methods

Rather than port forwarding, third party services like TeamViewer, LogMeIn and AnyDesk use their own secure connection servers so a device can be accessed remotely without opening ports on the home router. For Linux systems, creating an SSH key allows command line remote access via encrypted connections without port forwarding. Windows systems can enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and provide a username and password for remote access that bypasses open ports.

### Secure Remote Access without Port Forwarding 

Services like ngrok can establish secure encrypted tunnels between a client and server without publicly exposing open ports. It acts as a reverse proxy, protecting the origin server by concealing its exposed IP address and ports from the public internet. Both ends of the communication channel are authenticated so only authorized clients can connect, avoiding the vulnerabilities of forwarding open ports.

### Assigning a Static IP Address

To maintain a consistent address, the server computer needs to be assigned a static IP address rather than use dynamic address allocation through DHCP. This can be configured through router network settings by either excluding an address range from DHCP or manually mapping a reserved address to the server's unique MAC address. A static IP allows remote devices to reliably locate the server on the private network for connection without a changing address.

### Configuring Port Forwarding on a Router

The steps to configure port forwarding on a home router typically involve navigating to the port forwarding or virtual server section of the router administrative interface. Here the internal IP address of the server computer and the external port are entered, normally port 25565 for a Minecraft server. Any firewall settings should also be checked and configured to allow connections to the forwarded port while continuing to block unwanted traffic.

### Other Options Beyond Port Forwarding

Rather than port forwarding, a VPN service provides an alternative method for secure remote access by routing all internet traffic between a client and home network through the VPN provider's private network tunnel. For trusted users, this avoids publicly exposing open ports. Limiting remote access only to close friends or family also helps prevent unwanted access. Regular backups ensure any data or configuration changes can be restored in the event of a compromised server.

### Summary 

In conclusion, while port forwarding itself is not inherently insecure, it does introduce additional vulnerabilities that cybercriminals may attempt to exploit such as open ports and exposed public IP addresses. Following best security practices like strong unique passwords, keeping software up-to-date, enabling firewall protection, limiting open ports, and considering safer alternatives can help minimize risks. Ongoing server maintenance like monitoring logs and backups also contributes to a more secure environment when remotely accessing a home server publicly online.
