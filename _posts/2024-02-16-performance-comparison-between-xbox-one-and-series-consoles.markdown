## Introduction
While the Xbox Series consoles are generally more powerful than the Xbox One consoles, game performance can vary depending on developer optimization choices. 
### Hardware specifications vary across consoles
The Xbox Series X and Series S offer significantly more powerful processors and graphics chips compared to their Xbox One counterparts. However, the Xbox One X still provides capable specs that allow it to match some games at 4K resolution. Optimizing for each console's hardware takes work from developers.

### Frame rates and resolutions depend on implementation
With their upgraded internals, the Series consoles can typically run games at higher **resolutions and frame rates** with better visuals. Yet whether titles leverage the full capabilities of each system depends on the efforts put in by individual development teams. 
### Series S aims for 1080p 60fps by default
While very capable of running most games, the Series S targets 1080p output at a smooth **60 frames per second** as a baseline. Reaching this benchmark consistently takes work from studios to add and test different graphics options.
## Comparing One X to Series S Performance
Due to similar graphical specs, certain games better optimized for the One X may perform comparably or better than the Series S on that system. However, the Series S benefits from a substantially more advanced processor overall. 
### Graphical parity on certain titles  
A small number of multi-platform games may run at an equal level of quality on both consoles in terms of **resolutions and effects**. But over time most will see upgrades on Series hardware.
### Work remains for developers to maximize potential
Whether a title fully leverages the Series S depends on if developers implement and thoroughly test 1440p or 1080p/60fps modes. Additional optimization is necessary to uncap its capabilities.
## Achieving Steady Frame Rates on Series S
While capable of reliable 1080p/60fps output, reaching this goal requires effort from developers. Many games are built first prioritizing **4K resolutions at 30 frames per second** on high-end consoles before considering other presets.
### Additional modes need implementing and testing
More work goes into adding different graphical presets for resolutions and frame rates. Games like Forza Motorsport 7 and Rise of the Tomb Raider allow explicitly selecting a 60fps option, but not all titles do.  
### Potential for higher resolutions at 60fps exists  
With optimization, the Series S could certainly hit **60fps at 1080p or 1440p**. But realizing this depends on development teams fully customizing their ports.
## Leveraging Power of Series X and S Hardware  
The Series X and S benefit from considerably more graphical grunt under the hood compared to predecessors. This extra horsepower opens several opportunities when optimized.
### Near constant 4K output on Series X
Whereas One X could match some games at 4K, the Series X provides the muscle to deliver near-ubiquitous 4K across many titles through its advanced GPU.
### Massively faster loading with integrated SSDs  
Its ultra-fast custom SSD allows Games to boot in mere seconds and drastically reduces waiting between levels, zones or respawns. Loading screens become a thing of the past.
### Support for up to 120Hz output  
While few games run above 60fps currently, Series consoles enable outputting at up to 120Hz for higher refresh rate displays. Future games may take fuller advantage over time.
### Backward compatibility with past generations  
The Series also maintains compatibility with thousands of existing Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games through enhanced backward compatibility features.
## Series Consoles Enhancements over One Systems
Put simply, Series X and S deliver clear upgrades in specs and graphics potential versus predecessors. But how well each game fulfills this varies based on development priorities and efforts.  
### Consistent 4K/60 possible whereas One X had limitations 
The raw power permits targeting steady 4K/60fps combinations more dependably across wide variety of titles instead of scarce high-profile exceptions. 
### Much faster load times thanks to NVMe SSDs
Throughputs multiply compared to mechanical drives in Ones. Virtually no wait transitioning between gameplay sections or restarting from checkpoints. 
### Enhanced lighting, geometry and textures 
Series CPUs help increase on-screen objects, character details and ambient occlusion effects. Textures can utilize large amounts of VRAM.
### Backward compatible catalog enhanced
Through hardware emulation assists performance of legacy games from Xbox, 360 and early One generations including some enhancements like higher resolutions.
## Varied Experiences on Original Xbox Ones
Compared to high-end Series hardware, the base Xbox One sees more inconsistent performance between games due to less robust internals.
### Struggles to maintain solid 30fps at default settings  
Demanding titles may lag into the low 20s fps range on original Xbox One hardware when graphical presets are set to default console presets. 
### Drastically longer loading screens  
Relying on slower hard drives instead of SSDs results in waiting excessively longer when transitioning between in-game locations versus solid-state equipped consoles.
### Fine for less graphically intense games
However less taxing experiences generally hold steady at or above 30fps with potential drops into the upper 20s periodically depending on on-screen activity.
### Enhanced experience on One S and X models
Stepping up to mid-generation S and beefier X consoles provided boosted internals that saw most games hit or exceed 30fps consistently with better visuals too.
## Series Consoles Elevate the Modern Gaming Experience  
In summary, Series X and S represent a clear evolution beyond initial Xbox models in terms of power housed under their sleek exteriors. But realizing full potential relies on development skillsets optimizing software accordingly.
