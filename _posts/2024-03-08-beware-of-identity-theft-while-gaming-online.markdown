### Getting Consent is Crucial for Shared Accounts
If you enjoy games through a shared family account, clear permission is required before making any purchases. Even using your own money on another person's linked payment details without explicit approval counts as **theft under the law**. Always get clear consent upfront from the account holder whenever spending any funds through a shared profile. **Failure to do so** opens you up to potential **identity theft charges** that can seriously impact your future. Communication and transparency protect both parties and keep gaming lawful and hassle-free. 
### Have Patience and Wait for Deep Discount Deals  
Rather than caving to temptation and stealing, show discipline by saving your allowance or doing small jobs for extra cash. Top gaming titles routinely see **huge price cuts** of 50% or more during big seasonal sales. For example, Steam's summertime and winter sales offer **deep discounts** on many AAA and indie games. With a little patience, you can score great deals legally and still enjoy your hobby without financial stress. Going the legitimate route protects your freedom and keeps you safely within the bounds of the law.
### Research Highly Rated Games on a Budget
Take some time on sites like YouTube to research the most acclaimed games across different genres. Finding well-reviewed titles that regularly go on sale allows you to strategically build a backlog of quality entertainment without breaking the bank. For instance, action-adventure franchises like Batman: Arkham and Assassin's Creed often see their latest entries marked down within a year. Doing your homework pays off with top-quality choices that won't strain your budget. Planning smart purchases averts the temptation to steal and keeps you gaming happily within legal and ethical limits. 
### The Serious Risks of an Identity Theft Charge
While stealing may seem like a quick fix, identity theft carries highly punitive penalties if caught. Police take reports of stolen funds or personal details incredibly seriously due to the real harm caused. Prosecutors are likely to pursue such cases aggressively in court. Convictions usually involve serious **fines, fees, probation terms or even imprisonment** depending on the specifics. A momentary lapse that seemed trivial at the time can seriously derail your entire life path with lasting damage to your record. The minor gain is never worth bearing such massive risks to your future freedom and prosperity. Play smart and avoid this life-ruining crime at all costs.
### Protect Yourself and Others Through Responsibility
