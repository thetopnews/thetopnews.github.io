### The Hardware Differences Make It Impossible
The Nintendo Switch Lite differs significantly from the original Switch in its hardware configuration. Most notably, the Switch Lite **lacks video-out functionality** found in the regular Switch since it does not include any of the **ports or components needed for HDMI output.** Unlike the Switch, the Switch Lite only has a single USB-C port solely for **charging capabilities.** This port cannot output video signals to connect to a television or computer monitor. The Switch dock acts as more than just a USB-C connector, including additional circuitry to enable **high-definition video output over USB-C.** However, without these necessary internal components, the Switch Lite is not able to display its screen on an external display.

### Incompatibility with the Switch Dock
Even if the Switch Lite included video-out functionality, its compact size and button placement would still prevent it from fitting inside the Switch dock. Measuring in at about 30% smaller than the original Switch, the Switch Lite does not have the same dimensions required to properly connect to the dock. Additionally, its **analog sticks are positioned lower on the unit**, unlike the Switch which has them higher to align with the dock's connectors. A USB-C to HDMI adapter alone would not work to output video either, as it still needs the internal hardware from the original Switch to enable **USB-C alternate mode for video transmission.**
### Homebrew Screen Mirroring Not Viable Yet  
While ambitious **homebrew developers** may one day create software to allow Switch Lite screen mirroring to a computer or mobile device over WiFi, such homebrew applications do not currently exist. Even if they did, streaming compressed video over a home network may lead to visual artifacts and decreased **frame rates** depending on connection speeds. Wireless display technologies like Miracast are also limited by the hardware and software, making reliable high-quality streaming unlikely without significant workarounds. For the best big screen experience, the Lite was designed strictly for small screen **handheld gameplay.**
### Using a Camera Has Too Many Drawbacks
Setting up a phone or dedicated HDMI camera to pointedly capture and display the Switch Lite's screen inevitably comes with various usability issues. Important aspects like **controller response times, screen latency,** and audio syncing become compromised delivering an unsatisfying experience. The constant need to carefully position and focus a recording device also disrupts regular gameplay. These workarounds are far more hassle than they are worth for most users.
### Upgrading to the Standard Switch is Recommended 
While creative solutions exist, for those seeking a true TV-connected gaming experience, purchasing the original Nintendo Switch makes the most practical sense. Its **TV-out compatibility and versatility** to be played on the TV or as a handheld provides more value. The Switch Lite was deliberately engineered as a dedicated handheld without video output abilities, so expecting those features through complicated workarounds misses the intended design focus. 
### Capturing Gameplay Remotely is an Alternative
Owners who already have a Switch Lite but want to share gameplay can consider using additional gear to record and stream their sessions. Pairing a smartphone camera on a tripod with a wireless controller allows capturing clean footage from a distance without obstructed views. Using a device like the Elgato HD60S connected to the Switch Lite via the USB-C port keeps audio in sync during streams while maintaining quality via the capture card's encoding. However, this is still not a true TV gaming experience.
### Equipment for Remote Capture 
Tripods provide steady camera positioning for smooth gameplay videos without blurry or shaky footage. Models with flexible joints allow adjusting the camera angle easily. Portable tripod kits that pack down small suit capturing on the go. For recording audio, lavalier microphones clip onto shirts or wirelessly transmit high-quality sound. When paired with a capture card like the Elgato Game Capture HD60 S, it preserves both video and audio through the device's USB-C connection. This minimizes latency compared to wireless solutions, though doesn't fully replace playing on an HDTV.
### Keeping the Portability in Mind  
As a dedicated handheld, the Switch Lite was created with maximum mobility as a primary design goal. Weighing less than a third of a pound lighter than the standard Switch, every ounce was trimmed for extended comfortable play sessions away from home. While creative workarounds can somewhat replicate the TV experience, they undermine the Lite's advantages of go-anywhere instant pick-up-and-play versatility. Many owners prefer this untethered freedom over a bulkier console tethered to the TV. Remember that the Switch Lite excels as an on-the-go portable, not a full home console replacement. 
### No Substitute for Native Video Output
Unfortunately, as enticing as the possibility may seem, no amount of technical wizardry can make up for the Switch Lite hardware's inherent lack of video out functionality. Even future exploits are unlikely to pull off seamless HDMI output or reliable screen mirroring without major impediments. While workarounds give a glimpse into displaying the Lite's screen externally, they cannot fully recreate the low-latency experience of playing natively on a big HDTV. Those seeking that TV-gaming experience will need to consider the standard Nintendo Switch model instead.
