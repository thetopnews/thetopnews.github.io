Changing your Epic Games display name is a simple process that only takes a few minutes. Let's break down the steps to update your profile with a new online identity.
### **Logging into Your Epic Games Account**

### **Navigating to Your Account Management Dashboard**
Once signed in, locate the "Settings" option within the main navigation menu near the top of the screen. Click this link to access your personal account management portal. The settings page houses all customizable elements tied to your Epic profile, including the ability to modify your public display name.
### **Locating the Display Name Change Feature**  
Under the main "Account" subsection, look for the "**Change Display Name**" link. This toggles the in-place editor used for modifying your profile's publicly visible username. Tap the highlighted text to activate the text field where you can enter your new display name choice.
### **Choosing and Inputting a New Display Name**
Ideally, select a display name between 3-16 characters that feels both unique and representative of your online personality. Avoid using special symbols or illegal characters that violate Epic's community guidelines. Type your new display name choice clearly into the text field provided, keeping in mind this name will be how others identify you within supported Epic services and games like Fortnite.
### **Reviewing and Submitting the Name Change Request** 
Before finalizing the update, double check that your new display name was entered correctly as intended. Verify there are no typographical errors present. Once satisfied, tap the prominent "Submit" button to process the change request through Epic's backend systems. 
### **Confirming and Completing the Process**
Upon hitting submit, you'll immediately receive a pop-up notification box verifying that your display name change was successful. This confirms your public profile details across Epic services have now been updated everywhere to reflect the new identity you provided. No further action is needed on your part to complete the process.
### **Customizing Additional Profile Settings**  
Now that your display name has been altered, take some time to explore other customizable elements within your Epic account management dashboard. Optional fields like your profile photo, email address, password, privacy controls and more can also be tweaked to your preferences. Ensuring these supplemental details remain accurate helps maintain an organized online presence.
### **Troubleshooting Potential Issues**
If unable to locate the display name editor for any reason, check Epic's frequently asked questions (FAQ) knowledge base for common resolutions. Searching online forums is another troubleshooting tactic to try. As a last resort, you can always reach out to Epic's customer support team for direct assistance via live chat, phone or email support. Their agents have back-end privileges to manually force through a display name update on your behalf if a bug is identified.
### **Using Your New Display Name Across Supported Services**  
With the change completely rolled out, sign out of your current Epic session and then sign back in to force a refresh. From here on out, your new display name will be prominently featured wherever your Epic profile and gaming activities are viewable, such as within Fortnite, the Epic Games storefront, and any affiliated third-party integrations. Others will now recognize you by the new identity you selected.
### **Repeating the Process for Future Name Updates**
While Epic only allows one display name change every two weeks for anti-fraud purposes, you're free to continue refining your online persona over time. Maybe reconsidering a more mature or personalized display name down the road. Whenever ready, simply navigate back to the "Settings" area to rerun the editing steps outlined here. Keeping your profile details refreshed helps craft the ideal virtual image and brand for your Epic account.
### **Maintaining a Family-Friendly and Positive Online Presence**  
As a reminder, Epic enforces strict content policies around display names and any other user-generated elements. Refrain from selecting anything obscene, dangerous, racist or that promotes harm. Stick with mild, warm and welcoming options that anyone could feel comfortable interacting with. This small effort helps foster a welcoming community experience for all players and families alike enjoying Epic's gaming services.
In summary, changing your Epic Games display name takes just a few minutes using the in-game settings panel. With the steps above, you now know how to claim a new identity and leave your mark across one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. Maintain an organized profile tailored to your online personality. Most importantly, represent yourself in a positive and team-oriented spirit for fun experiences with other players wherever Epic services are concerned.
