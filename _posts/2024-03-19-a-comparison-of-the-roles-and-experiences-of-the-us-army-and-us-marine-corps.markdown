### Early Distinctions in Mission and Size
The **US Marine Corps** began as a small force responsible for naval expeditionary and shipboard security operations following the American Civil War. In contrast, the larger **US Army** held primary responsibility for land-based combat and operations. During World War I, both branches took on expanded ground combat roles in Europe, fighting alongside one another. However, the Marines maintained a smaller force size focused more narrowly on expeditionary operations.

### Parallel Paths in Vietnam 
From 1965 to 1973, over half a million US servicemembers served in the Republic of Vietnam. Both the Army and Marines conducted similar combat and security missions throughout this protracted conflict. The Marines established a presence in northern I Corps with Task Force Delta, participating in operations to defend the DMZ region and conduct offensive sweeps of contested areas. Like their Army counterparts further south, Marine units faced entrenched enemies and the challenges of jungle warfare. 
### Evolving Amphibious Doctrine and Capabilities
While originally created for **amphibious assault operations**, the Marine Corps expanded its missions over time to include other expeditionary tasks. The brief period of large-scale amphibious invasions ended following World War II, as naval assault needs declined and strategic priorities shifted. However, the Army has carried out **some of the largest amphibious operations in history** to project power from the sea, utilizing Marine capabilities when required. Both services continue refining amphibious warfare concepts and interoperability today.
### Unique Recruiting Approaches for Shared Service
The Marine Corps recruiting message emphasizes the **hardship and difficulties** that come with service, not potential career benefits or technical training. In contrast, Army recruiters tend to highlight post-military education funds, technical skills training, and potential career experiences. However, both branches equip recruits with the basic weapons and tools for **frontline infantry combat**, understanding their shared duty is to close with and destroy the enemy on distant battlefields when called upon by the nation. 
### A Marine’s Personal Encounters with War
Many young American men answered their nation’s call during the Vietnam War. The author joined the Marine Corps in 1966 after listening to a recruiter’s evocative pitch about service and sacrifice. As an infantryman, he deployed to Vietnam, experiencing the rigors of monsoon season and prolonged combat at firebases like Khe Sanh. His own story reflects the harsh realities so many Marines, Soldiers, Airmen and Sailors faced during that turbulent era.
### Commonalities in Combat Despite Distinctions
Regardless of service branch affiliations, all who enter direct ground combat face tremendous hardships and mortal dangers. Many pay the ultimate price in defense of freedom. The roles of the US Army and Marine Corps **frontline infantry** have been remarkably consistent for over a century - close with and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver. Though their institutional cultures differ, in places like Vietnam their missions and sacrifices fundamentally overlapped on the battlefield. 
### A Legacy of Shared Service and Sacrifice
While maintaining their separate identities, specialties, and traditions, the core combat functions of the US Army and Marine Corps have been aligned for over a century. Both proudly serve the nation through its most trying conflicts, often operating side-by-side in the same battlespaces under tremendous burdens. Their shared legacy demonstrates the incredible courage and dedication of all who answer the call to close with the enemy through ground combat, whether one wears Army green or Marine blue.
