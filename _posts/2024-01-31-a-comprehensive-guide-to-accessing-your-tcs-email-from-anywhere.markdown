## Login Credentials for Secure Remote Access to Your TCS Email Account
Getting set up to access your TCS email remotely requires two distinct login credentials. You will need your **Ultimatix VPN** credentials to establish a secure VPN connection. This includes your **Ultimatix username and password**. With the VPN in place, you can then login to your actual email account using your standard **TCS email username and password**. Be sure to keep both sets of login credentials in a secure, password-protected location for easy access when needed.
### Configuring the Ultimatix VPN App on Your Device 
To connect to the Ultimatix VPN, you'll first need to download and configure the official VPN client app. The app is available on all major mobile and desktop platforms. During setup, you'll be prompted to enter your assigned **Ultimatix VPN username and password**. Take note of any two-factor authentication steps as well. With everything configured, you'll then be ready to securely connect to the VPN network remotely.

### Logging into Your TCS Email Account
Once connected to the VPN, launch a web browser and navigate to the TCS email login page. Enter your standard **TCS email address** in the username field. Then, input your assigned email **account password** to complete the login process. With both sets of credentials entered correctly, you'll now have full access to your TCS email inbox, sent items, contacts, and more directly from any internet-connected device.
## Synchronizing Your TCS Email to Mobile Devices
While VPN access works great from laptops and desktops, it can be inconvenient for mobile access on the go. Thankfully, TCS allows email **synchronization to mobile devices**, eliminating the need to establish the VPN connection each time. 
### Enabling Mobile Sync via a Support Ticket
To take advantage of mobile sync, simply open a support ticket with Ultimatix. Provide your name, employee ID, and request to enable **email synchronization to mobile**. The support team will then configure your account for mobile sync over the secure Ultimatix network. 
### Setting Up the Synced Email Account on Your Phone
Once approved, Ultimatix will reply with instructions for setting up the synced email account on your phone. Generally, you'll open the mail app on your iOS or Android device and select "Add Account". Choose your mail provider (Microsoft Exchange, etc.), then enter the sync details provided by Ultimatix. Your TCS inbox should then sync seamlessly to the mobile mail app for offline access.
## Resources for Common TCS Questions & Concerns 
Getting set up with all the various TCS systems and services can understandably lead to questions. Thankfully, there are some helpful resources available to TCS employees seeking answers.
### The All About TCS Space on Quora
Quora hosts an open knowledge-sharing platform called "All About TCS" that's dedicated to addressing common inquiries. Here, verified TCS employees and others in the know frequently weigh in on topics like **TCS HR processes, IT systems, company policies and procedures**. It's a great place to search for pre-existing responses or ask your own questions.
### Your Manager, HR Team, or IT Support
Of course, some issues may warrant a more direct line of support. Don't hesitate to reach out to your direct manager for guidance on work-related matters. Human resources experts can also likely address pay, benefits and compliance questions that arise. The in-house IT help desk team, Ultimatix support in this case, is always there to assist with technical account and systems issues as well.
## Ensuring Security Compliance with VPN Usage
While mobile email sync provides flexibility, there are compliance reasons why VPN access is still required from external networks. As a global services firm, TCS has an obligation to help safeguard client and company information. The VPN acts as an essential security measure in this role.
### Protecting Sensitive Data Assets 
Customer data is among TCS's most valuable assets. The VPN creates an encrypted "tunnel" that prevents sensitive data from being exposed in transit over unsecured public networks. It also only allows access from fully authenticated and authorized employee devices and locations.
### Maintaining Regulatory Compliance 
Many of TCS's clients operate in regulated industries that have strict data privacy and security compliance mandates like GDPR, HIPAA and more. Using the VPN brings remote access in line with these various industry and regional information security standards. This helps ensure both TCS and its clients remain compliant.
### Avoiding Data Breaches and Theft 
Without the VPN safeguard, there would be increased risk of a data breach event. Bad actors on public networks could more easily intercept, read or even modify emails and attached files in transit. The VPN encryption protects against these cybercrimes and reduces the chance of leaked sensitive data.
## Setting Up Mobile Email Sync  
As mentioned earlier, syncing mail to a mobile device for offline access is a convenient alternative to continuous VPN usage. Let's review the standard process for requesting and configuring this feature.
### Submitting the Support Request
To begin, simply log into the Ultimatix support portal and select "New Ticket". Provide basic contact details along with a description of your request to enable "Email Sync to Mobile." The ticket will then be routed to the appropriate team. 
### Setting Expectations for Response Time
Depending on volume, it can take 1-2 business days to process routine sync requests once received. For expedited assistance, contact your local Ultimatix administrator. They may be able to facilitate a quicker enablement. Otherwise, plan for a response within 48 hours once the ticket is assigned.
### Following Configuration Instructions Carefully  
When approved, Ultimatix will reply with sync setup instructions for your specific mobile mail client (Outlook, Gmail etc). Take time to fully understand each step. Configuring account details incorrectly could prevent syncing or expose data. Contact support promptly if you run into issues to ensure everything is configured securely.
## Alternatives for VPN Unavailability
Even with the preparation outlined, internet or VPN connectivity issues may occasionally prevent access. Thankfully, there are still options when the VPN isn't an option.
### Ask Colleagues to Forward Urgent Emails
If the VPN goes down during work hours, colleagues co-located with reliable connectivity can forward any mission-critical emails your way to avoid delays. Just be sure any attachments containing sensitive data are also encrypted or sent securely. 
### Follow Up Upon Return to Office 
When traveling, save the number for your office's internet service provider in case the hotel or remote location loses connection. Give them a call for support or plan to follow up with any urgent work matters immediately after returning when VPN access resumes.
## Maintaining Secure Connectivity  
Whether using the TCS VPN or mobile sync, it's important to practice good security hygiene to keep company systems and data protected at all times.
### Never Share Credentials or Session Details
Your login credentials should remain wholly confidential. Avoid leaving a device unattended while connected or sharing sign-in information that could compromise your account. 
### Log Out Fully When Email is Not in Use
When stepping away, ensure all email sessions are closed completely on all devices to prevent unauthorized access in the case of loss or theft. Shut down browsers to log out fully as well for added protection.
### Beware of Public WiFi Connections 
When connecting from airports, coffee shops and other open hotspots, hackers could potentially see traffic. Consider using mobile data instead of sending sensitive emails over unsecured public networks if possible.
### Keep Software Up to Date for Latest Security 
Apply any operating system, browser or mobile app updates promptly to fix bugs or vulnerabilities that emerge over time. Outdated devices or programs are more prone to cyber risks compared to utilizing the most current software versions.
