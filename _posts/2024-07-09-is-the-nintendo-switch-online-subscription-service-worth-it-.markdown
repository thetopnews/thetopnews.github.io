## Introduction
The Nintendo Switch has risen to become one of the best-selling consoles of all time since its launch in 2017, thanks to innovative hybrid handheld/home console design and a strong library of acclaimed franchises and indie games. However, unlike its competitors, the Switch lacked a paid online subscription service for the first two years. **In September 2019, Nintendo finally launched its first paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription**. The service provides access to online multiplayer gaming, a growing selection of classic NES and SNES titles, and optional cloud save backups for a low monthly or annual fee. But does the service provide enough value currently to justify the transition from free to paid online play? Let's take a closer look.
### Evaluating the Value of Nintendo Switch Online
In this article, we will examine the key features and offerings included with Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions, evaluate the various pricing tier options, and assess the overall online multiplayer experience on the console to determine if the service represents a good value for Switch owners looking to play online. We'll also discuss persisting concerns around voice chat support and whether the price ultimately makes sense given what customers now have to pay for what was previously a free utility.

## What's Included with a Nintendo Switch Online Subscription
### Access to Online Multiplayer Games
Perhaps the biggest draw of Nintendo Switch Online is gaining the ability to play compatible Switch games online with others. Titles like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and more support robust online modes, but require an active subscription to access. Subscribers can enjoy multiplayer mayhem online across the service's supported library of over 50 games. 
### Library of Classic NES and SNES Games
In addition to online play, Nintendo Switch Online grants access to a growing selection of classic NES and SNES games that can be downloaded and played. Current titles include iconic games like Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, F-Zero, and StarFox. Nintendo regularly adds new games **to one of the largest virtual console libraries.**
### Cloud Save Data Backups
For a small selection of Switch games supporting the feature, an Online subscription allows save data to be automatically backed up to the cloud. This provides a safeguard against losing progress due to a system failure or needing to re-download games on a new Switch console. The ability to easily recover game saves across devices adds important convenience and peace of mind for dedicated players.
### Special Offers and Discounts
Nintendo periodically offers exclusive deals and competitive pricing through Nintendo Switch Online on select digital games and add-on content. Subscribers get early access to promotions for big new releases along with occasional discounts **on some of the hottest Nintendo Switch games.** Keeping an eye out for these limited-time sales can help subscribers save money in the long run.  
## Nintendo Switch Online Subscription Options and Pricing
### Individual Plans
Nintendo Switch Online individual plans come in three options - $3.99 for one month, $7.99 for three months, or $19.99 for a full year. Opting for the annual plan proves to be the best value long-term, amounting to only $1.67 per month on average over the course of a year.
### Family Plan 
For families with multiple Switch consoles, Nintendo also offers an annual Family Membership for $34.99 that allows up to 8 separate Nintendo Accounts to enjoy all Nintendo Switch Online benefits. This can make sharing a subscription more affordable across household members.
### Monthly vs Yearly Plans 
While shorter term monthly and quarterly subscriptions offer flexibility, they work out to be considerably more expensive in the long run compared to the yearly option. Players expecting to use Nintendo Switch Online for a full year or more are strongly encouraged to opt for the year-long subscription to maximize their value and savings.
## Does Nintendo Switch Online Improve the Online Experience?  
### Ongoing Stability and Connection Issues  
One of the biggest hopes for the subscription model was that dedicated funding could help Nintendo bolster and stabilize the backend services powering online play. However, the service's launch did not immediately resolve all lingering problems. Titles like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate still suffer sporadic lag and dropped games that frustrate competitive players.
### Room for Steady Enhancements
That said, overhauling networking code for big games is no small task. And Nintendo has shown signs of being receptive to user feedback, applying server-side patches to address specific issues. Further optimization is still needed, but conditions have modestly improved compared to the pre-subscription era. Dedicated servers for key titles and additional network tuning over time could continue strengthening the experience.
### Potential for Exciting New Features   
With a stable revenue stream now in place, Nintendo is in a good position to explore ambitious new online capabilities powered by their subscription funds. Exciting possibilities like incorporated voice chat, improved matchmaking, persistent online worlds, and community features keep the future bright if capitalized on properly.
## Lack of In-Game Voice Chat Persists as a Drawback
### Fortnite and Other Third-Party Alternatives
While top third-party multiplayer games on Switch like Fortnite offer full-featured voice chat in their mobile apps, first-party Nintendo titles remain limited to text communication only. This glaring omission places the platform at a disadvantage versus competitors that allow seamless in-game chat.
### Frustrations Over Repeated Delays 
Nintendo first teased voice functionality would arrive alongside the online service over a year ago. But integration has faced continuous pushbacks, leaving many disappointed subscribers without one of the core social experiences expected in modern multiplayer gaming. 
### Hopes for an Imminent Solution
With significant engineering effort having now passed, hopes remain high that Nintendo will soon unlock this missing communication component through a future firmware update. Providing parity in social features could help ensure the Switch remains a compelling option even for avid online fans moving forward.
## Is the Price of Nintendo Switch Online Justified? 
### Competitively Priced Entry Point
At only $20 or less annually, Nintendo Switch Online undercuts comparable offerings from Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus. For casual players, the price of admission provides fair value considering the library of classic games also included.
### Justification for Required Fee Remains Debatable 
However, online play was gratis in the Switch's first two years, so the forced subscription leaves a sour taste and valid questions over whether extra features truly compensate established users. While saving progress to the cloud does offer appeal, the lack of touted capabilities like cross-play or voice chat prevents the service from maximizing potential worth at this stage.
### Value Assessment Depends on Usage Levels
For avid online gamers, cloud backups, and regular discount access, the subscription undoubtedly proves worthwhile. More intermittent users facing the same payment barrier may find less individual gain for the mandatory costs even at the low annual price point. Long-term, expanded features could help justify the model for a wider audience.
## Conclusion - Room for Growth But Shows Promise 
In summarization, Nintendo Switch Online fills an important role by finally bringing a paid framework to the console's online components and multiplayer functions through dedicated funding sources. Features like classic game access and cloud saves add desirable utility. However, the transition from a freely usable system to one now requiring fees remains an understandible sticking point among customers. Persistent connectivity issues and the omission of voice chat also hold the experience back.
Yet Nintendo has displayed a commitment to building upon the service, applying server fixes, and teasing future developments. If these continued improvements come to fruition while maintaining fair pricing, Nintendo Switch Online has all the capabilities to transform into an exemplary online network worthy of its own merits. But for now, the service retains flaws that prevent it from achieving its full potential value. With steady refinements on the way, subscription worth remains at a reasonable but not definitive standing. Only time will tell if the gamble on a paid model pans out as a worthwhile long-term investment for Switch owners.
