### Part 1: Connect the Original Xbox One Wireless Controller 
The original Xbox One controller uses **proprietary wireless technology instead of Bluetooth**. To connect wirelessly, you'll need the **Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows**. This adapter supports up to **four controllers** for local multiplayer gaming. It also provides a stronger wireless signal than Bluetooth for a more **stable, lag-free connection**. 
To pair the controller, plug the adapter into a USB port on your PC. Press and hold the pairing button on the top of the controller until the Xbox button begins flashing. The controller should automatically connect to the adapter. You're now ready to start playing wirelessly from up to **30 feet away**.
### Part 2: Connect via Bluetooth with Newer Xbox One Controllers
Newer Xbox One controllers have built-in **Bluetooth connectivity**, eliminating the need for a separate adapter. To pair wirelessly, ensure your PC has Bluetooth enabled. Press and hold the pairing button on the top of the controller until the Xbox button flashes rapidly. The controller should now appear in your Bluetooth and device manager settings. Simply select it to connect. 
These controllers can also connect to the Xbox Wireless Adapter if you prefer its longer range. And if you want a wired connection, hooking up with a USB cable is simple. Bluetooth pairing provides an easy, adapter-free option for **untethered gameplay** on newer models.
### Part 3: Use Official Adapters for Best Performance

Spending the extra few dollars on an authentic adapter helps ensure a seamless, frustration-free wireless experience. You won't have to troubleshoot **stuttering controls or disconnects** potentially caused by compatibility problems. For reliable gameplay, the official adapter is well worth the investment.
### Part 4: Connect Original Xbox 360 Controllers Too
In addition to newer Xbox One controllers, the Xbox Wireless Adapter is fully compatible with the classic Xbox 360 wireless controllers as well.

And since they've been out for years, you may be able to find Xbox 360 controllers at even lower prices than basic Xbox One models. 
Regardless of which Xbox generation you prefer, the adapter allows wireless play with a wide range of controllers. So feel free to keep using your well-worn Xbox 360 pads, or pick up a cheap used one online. The adapter delivers unified wireless support across the Xbox family.
### Part 5: Ensure Your Controller and PC are Up to Date
Proper updates are essential for seamless wireless connectivity. Make sure your Xbox controller is running the latest firmware for optimized compatibility with Windows. Similarly, keeping your Windows installation and drivers current patches any bugs or vulnerabilities.
If you run into issues pairing or have inconsistent connection quality, it may help to reinstall the Xbox Accessories app and driver. This refreshes the files and settings governing wireless support. Finally, checking your game's version and updating graphics/input drivers can resolve software-specific conflicts.
Taking a few minutes to update everything helps avoid frustration down the line. So before troubleshooting, investing the time for preventative maintenance could solve potential problems.
### Part 6: Contact Support if Issues Persist  
Even with updating and troubleshooting, some connection woes may linger. If you continue having problems getting controllers to pair or stay paired after following the advice above, your next step is to reach out to support teams for assistance.
Contacting Xbox support could help resolve driver or firmware-related bugs. And checking with the game developer provides insights on compatibility with their specific title. Professional help from the sources is usually knowledgeable and willing to investigate further. 
With patience and a little teamwork, virtually any technical hitch can be overcome. So if self-help fails, don't hesitate to tap official support channels for personalized guidance until a resolution is found.
