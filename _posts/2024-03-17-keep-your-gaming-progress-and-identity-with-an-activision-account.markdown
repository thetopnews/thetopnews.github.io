With the growing popularity of cross-platform play, it's more important than ever to maintain a consistent gaming profile across devices and platforms. An Activision account helps provide this by linking your progress and customizations between Call of Duty games on consoles like PlayStation and Xbox. Let's take a deeper look at how these unified accounts benefit players.
## Connect Your Profile with an Activision ID
Creating an Activision account is straightforward. The first time you launch a supported Call of Duty title such as **Modern Warfare 2019** or **Black Ops Cold War**, you'll be guided through setting up your Activision ID during the initial signup process. This involves choosing a unique username and password. 
From there, your Activision profile is accessible anytime you log into one of these networked games. Simply enter the same credentials, and your customized loadouts, camos, rank history, and other accomplishments will sync up between platforms. No need to start fresh or rely on a temporary "guest" profile when playing from a different console at a friend's house or elsewhere. 
### Keep Your Complete Game Identity
With a single sign-in, all aspects of your in-game character carry over. Your selected operator, weapon blueprints, battle pass progress - everything transfers seamlessly. This unified online identity means you never lose touch with your accomplishments or have to rebuild your loadouts from scratch. Your personalized gaming experience persists no matter if you're on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or any other compatible system.

### Access Your Profiles Anywhere 
Mobility is a key benefit of Activision accounts. Whether you primarily game on console but want to play some matches on your laptop during lunch, or like to swap between a home Xbox and a portable Nintendo Switch, your profile keeps pace with you. Log in using the same username from any supported device to pick up right where you left off.
### Stay Connected with Friends 
Not only does your profile move with you, but integrated social features let you stay connected to the broader Call of Duty community as well. With friends lists and recent players tabs accessible across platforms, it's simple to squad up with the same crews regardless of who is on what system at any given time.
## Microsoft Expands the Activision Portfolio
As the gaming industry continues consolidating major franchise IPs under a small number of corporate owners, what does this mean for players and cross-platform functionality? One company with ambitious plans in this area is Microsoft.
### Microsoft's Acquisition Strategy 
With its proposed $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, the software giant aims to expand its gaming foothold significantly. This deal, if finalized, would add household names like **Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch,** and **Candy Crush** to Microsoft's existing stable of studios behind franchises such as **Halo** and **Fallout.** 
Prior mega-buys such as Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax for $7.5 billion show Microsoft's strategy of bringing more blockbuster titles under its Xbox banner. But what does this concentration of power mean for choice and competition in the market long-term? Regulators are taking a close look.
### Potential Issues from Industry Consolidation
There is concern sweeping consolidation could reduce options for gamers over time. If a small number of mega-corporations own the bulk of major franchises, what implications does this have for pricing, exclusive deals, and consumer freedom? Only continued cross-compatibility between platforms can assuage these antitrust issues by keeping game libraries accessible regardless of preferred hardware.
### Microsoft's Commitment to Choice
In public statements, Microsoft pledges to continue supporting Activision games like Call of Duty on PlayStation consoles currently under contract, aiming to ease worries. The company also owns PC game storefront Windows and continues porting franchises there. As such, accessibility may not narrow too severely - if Microsoft delivers on its promises of choice. Only time will tell how licensing and platform relationships truly evolve post-acquisition if approved.
## Your Profile Journey Continues 
Whether games remain available across hardware or certain titles become exclusive down the line, **Activision accounts ensure your personalized achievement history lives on**. As new Call of Duty and Blizzard releases emerge, having a unified profile tied to your Activision ID means automatically retaining progression and investments made so far.
### Carry Progress between New Releases  
Each annual Call of Duty installment generally builds upon the last, with continued levels, weapons to unlock, battle passes to complete, and ranks to climb. An Activision account ties these experiences together over years of playing. Jump between the latest **Modern Warfare** and next **Black Ops** knowing your identity stays consistent.
### Remain a Unique Gamer
With no need to restart or separate your profiles by platform, you maintain a distinct online persona. Customize your operators, vehicles, weaponry - even competitive stats and career milestones - into a unique achievement history true to your gameplay. This personalized journey continues shining through on any supported device.
### A Future of Connected Gaming 
As technology advances and more blockbuster franchises come under consolidated publishers, unified online profiles will become even more essential for an integrated experience. Whether playing on a home console, portable Switch, or streaming to a phone, your customized accomplishments transcend barriers between hardware. An Activision account ties players' progress and identity together into the future of connected multi-device gaming.
## In Summary
By linking the Call of Duty universe to a single online identity, Activision accounts give gamers freedom and flexibility like never before. Keep leveling up soldiers, racking up kills, completing quests, and customizing loadouts - seamlessly carry it all between any console or system with a single sign-in. 
This unified profile means never losing touch with your accomplishments, investments or friends no matter if preferences change between PlayStation, Xbox, PC or beyond. As the industry changes, an integrated online identity also allows taking gaming journeys that transcend platforms further into the future. An Activision account is the key to maintaining a consistent experience as play expands across new frontiers in interactive entertainment.
