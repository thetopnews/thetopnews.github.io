## Introduction
Malaysia is a culinary paradise with a diverse array of delicious foods influenced by various cultures. In this guide, we will explore some of the best places to indulge your tastebuds and discover lesser-known Malaysian specialties to try. Whether you love street foods, hawker center fare, or fine dining, this Southeast Asian nation has it all. Get ready for an epic food journey!
### Kuala Lumpur and Malacca
The capital city of Kuala Lumpur and historic town of Malacca offer an amazing variety of food. Shopping malls in KL are filled with huge [food courts](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-10-30-exploring-castles-and-palaces-in-the-region/) housing 40-50 stalls each under one roof. One such food court I remember was located in **Paragon Shopping Mall**, directly across from KL Marriott Hotel. Malacca has fewer food courts but a lively **night market** where you can sample different dishes. Be sure to hop on one of Malacca's colorful **pedicab rides** blaring Disney songs - it's a memorable experience even for adults!

### Penang's Culinary Goldmine
Penang is renowned as a **foodie's paradise** with high hygiene standards.

Don't miss the **food halls** serving incredibly cheap meals. Must-tries in Georgetown include **Char Kway Teow**, curry **noodles**, and **roti bom** - diabetes on a plate but too irresistible to pass up.

Always say yes to sampling new and unusual foods on your journey.
