## Part 1 - Linking Your Epic Games Account
Skins, emotes, and other cosmetic items that you purchase in Fortnite can be used across **different platforms when** you link your accounts. If you buy a new outfit on your Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch or mobile device, that same item will be **visible on your account** when you log into Fortnite on PC or another console by **connecting your Epic Games profile**. 
### Linking Your Console Account 
To access your Fortnite items on multiple systems, you'll need to link your console account to your Epic Games profile. On PlayStation and Xbox, just log into the same Epic account that is associated with your purchases. The Nintendo Switch requires manually linking through the Epic website. Once completed, all of your cosmetics will show up regardless of which platform you play on.

### Contacting Customer Support
In rare cases, there can be glitches that prevent cross-platform **access to in-game skins or emotes purchased**. If items are missing after linking accounts, don't panic. Epic support representatives are there to help troubleshoot the issue and restore your **rightful access to all owned Fortnite cosmetics across every platform**.
## Part 2 - Segregation of Platforms in Matches 
While your unlockables can physically move between platforms, competitive gameplay is deliberately kept separated to maintain fair conditions for all players. Fortnite does not officially allow **cross-play between PC and consoles for competitions**. 
### Hardware and Control Differences
The main reason developer Epic Games segregates the platforms is the wide variations in hardware performance and input methods between PC and consoles. PCs are much more customizable and powerful than any console. Mouse and keyboard also provide a clear advantage over controllers for first-person shooter style **aiming accuracy in battle royale games like Fortnite**. 
### Maintaining a Level Playing Field 
If PC players were to end up in the same lobbies as those on PlayStation, Xbox or Switch, it would significantly disadvantage the console community. Frame rates are capped on consoles to ensure smooth function, while high-end PCs can easily reach hundreds of frames. Additionally, mouse inputs enable lighting-fast aiming that is nearly impossible to match using joysticks. Separating the platforms preserves an even battlefield for all competitive Fortnite players.
### Rare Accidental Cross-Play Matches
On infrequent occasions, it seems system bugs may have allowed cross-contamination between PC and console players in public matches. However, these incidents went against Epic's design intentions. The developers strive to keep platforms segregated to protect the experiences of every Fortnite athlete, regardless of the hardware they choose to play on.
## Part 3 - Console Limitations vs PC Configurability 
The technical deficiencies of consoles relative to customizable gaming PCs reinforce why separating the platforms enhances competitive fairness in Fortnite.
### Fixed Hardware Specifications
As pre-built machines with standardized specs, consoles cannot be customized or upgraded like PCs. Their internal components like processors and graphics cards become outdated over time as new hardware emerges. Console makers are also limited by size, noise and heat constraints unique to all-in-one solutions.
### Capped Frame Rates
To maintain consistent performance across all titles, consoles' CPU and GPU capabilities are stretched thin running modern games. As a result, frame rates are artificially capped rather than allowed to fluctuate freely. The latest generation maxes around 60 FPS, while high-end PCs easily exceed 200 FPS or more in Fortnite.  
### Controller Limitations  
While controllers work well for casual use, their analog sticks cannot match the speed or precision of mouse aiming. Rotating and tracking targets nearly instantaneously is very challenging using joysticks alone. The flexibility and granular controls of keyboards and mice will always have an advantage over gamepads for first-person experiences.
### Maintaining the Console Experience
Separating competitive playlists respects that consoles deliver a tailored experience within fixed hardware bounds. Forcing console athletes to compete against freely configurable PC setups would undermine the product experience console makers strive to provide their communities.
## Part 4 - Cross-Platform for Friendly Matches
While competitive cross-play between PC and consoles is prohibited, the same restriction does not apply to social and team modes in Fortnite. Players on different platforms can band together for fun casual matches and quests.
### Partying Up Regardless of Platform
Epic supports cross-friends lists, allowing those on separate systems like PC, PlayStation and mobile to easily join fireteam lobbies together. Once teamed up cross-platform, you can drop into modes like Team Rumble, 50v50 and Playground to enjoy Friendly competition. 
### Accommodating Diverse Gaming Circles
Many social Fortnite players have friends scattered across PC, consoles and handhelds. Cross-platform grouping respects these relationships by keeping everyone's gaming circles intact. You're not confined by hardware barriers or platform exclusives when cooperatively conquering challenges with pals.
### Leveling the Field with Adjusted Matchmaking
While the platforms intermingle freely in these laidback modes, Epic applies subtle adjustments to help balance discrepancies. Players on less powerful systems may face slightly easier opponents on average. And input-based matchmaking tries to match similar control types when practical for fairness.
### Valuing the Social Experience
By allowing various hardware to party up yet protecting competitive integrity, Fortnite satisfies users' social requirements while also addressing competitive disadvantages. This balanced approach recognizes gaming is about unified communities, not segmented markets.
## Part 5 - Demand From the Player Communities 
With Fortnite's colossal popularity across screens, its communities naturally pushed for the ability to play together regardless of platforms. But developers rightfully consider technical and competitive complications. 
### Appeals to "Cross-Play Please!"  
Over the years, passionate Fortnite fans started widespread campaigns pleading with Epic for official cross-platform functionality. Hashtags like #CrossPlayPlease spread on social networks in hopes developers would find solutions. Console manufacturers also heard appeals to relax platform restrictions.
### Uniting Fragmented Friends Lists
A common rallying point was reconnecting split friend groups torn apart by platform pockets. Many felt hardware barriers artificially fragmented online communities rather than uniting them as gaming should. Cross-play represented the ability to play as intended - together. 
### Competitive Integrity Remains a Top Priority
While sympathetic to social fan demands, Epic had to carefully examine technical, competitive and economic challenges compared to quick PR wins. Integrity and balance issues couldn't be ignored just because hardware distinctions divided social circles. Competitive fairness serves the long-term game's health.
### Cross-Play in Competitive Esports
Ultimately, Epic enabled robust cross-platform support for Fortnite's social and team modes. But competitive playlists rightfully maintain rigorous platform partitioning. This satisfy users' desires to group freely for fun while also shoring up the sanctioned esport's legitimacy. All stakeholders thus win.
## Part 6 - Standards Across the Game Industry 
Segregating PC and console competition isn't unique to Fortnite - it's a near-industry standard practice across titles that span PC and consoles. Developers globally appreciate the need to consider inherent performance divides between hardware.
### Console Manufacturer Policies 
Console-makers like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo exert strict controls over cross-play for their platforms due to business reasons. Historically, they wanted to avoid platform features that weakened perceived hardware value or competitive advantages. But rising consumer pressure pushed more openness over time.
### Controller vs Keyboard/Mouse 
Most shooters and competitive online games recognize the imbalance between gamepads and mouse/keyboard setups. Even AAA franchises like Call of Duty prohibit console and PC players from directly engaging one another in ranked play. Input-based matchmaking is common.  
### Maintaining Integrity League-Wide
Esports require consistent technical circumstances for all athletes. Allowing variable frame rates, resolutions, control schemes or hardware capabilities jeopardizes integrity and legitimacy across pro leagues overseen by governing bodies. Fairness needs enforcing league-wide.
### Social Modes are Cross-Platform 
While competitive modes stay segregated, most titles like Fortnite enable their fun social/coop contexts to span all available platforms. Players can happily interact here without worrying about technical performance gaps disrupting engagement.
## Part 7 - Consoles' Technical Realities 
Console gamers appreciate that competitive quarantines don't criticize their preferred platform, but recognize console hardware realities compared to open PCs. Developers prioritize the optimal experience given technical confines.
### Hardware is Fixed, Not Customized  
Consoles deliver consistent, standardized performance in tidy boxes. But their finite, unchangeable components trail leading PC components over a generation. Games are tuned around consistent console specs, not flexible PCs.
### Capped Frame Rates Preserve Stability
While hitches frustrate, uncapped frame rates risk instability. Capping frames maintains constant performance developers and players can rely on across all software. It's a necessary trade-off of the enclosed console format.
### Controller Limitations are Accepted 
Though joysticks restrict speed compared to mice, gamepads deliver convenience and precision enough for most players. Their handling of shooters shows improvement every generation too. Limitations don't detract from rich console experiences.
### Competitive Fairness Upholds Integrity
Segregating pro play by
