## Introduction
PlayStation Remote Play allows PS4 owners to stream and control their console on supported mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. This functionality provides a convenient way to continue gaming sessions or manage your library even when away from the TV. In this guide, we'll cover the essential steps to set up Remote Play, explore its main features, and provide tips for getting the most out of this remote gaming functionality.
### Downloading the PlayStation App
The first step is downloading the official PlayStation app from the **App Store** or **Google Play Store**. Only devices meeting the minimum system requirements are compatible with Remote Play. Once installed, the app allows remotely controlling your PS4 and viewing your games and media library from a mobile device anywhere on the same local WiFi network or internet connection.

### Connecting Devices to the Same Network
Both your PS4 and mobile device must be connected to the same local network, either via Ethernet cable or WiFi, for the app to detect and connect to the console. Make sure to set up your router and connect all devices before proceeding. The PS4 and mobile device do not need to be on the same Subnet but do need access to communicate over the WiFi network or hardwired connection. 
### Enabling Remote Play on Your PS4
Access the **Settings** menu on the console and select **"PSN" then "Remote Play Connection Settings."** A unique pairing code will generate that needs entering on the app. This pairs the devices and allows the mobile app to connect remotely to stream and control your PS4 games.
### Connecting Via the PlayStation App
Open the PlayStation app and select **"Connect to PS4"** to see all consoles on the local network. Tap the PS4 to connect, then enter the matching code shown on the console screen. Once paired, the app is ready to remotely access games, media, and system functions from a distance.
## Exploring Remote Play Features
### Controlling Your PS4 With the App
The app has intuitive touchscreen controls similar to using a DualShock controller at home. Swipe fingers on the screen to move and tap icons to select. In some supported games, the mobile screen can display an extra view while remotely controlling the PS4 display. 
### Additional Remote Play Functions
Access keyboard functionality through the app for easier text input than on a controller. Remotely turn off the PS4 directly from the mobile device after finishing a gaming session away from home. Check notifications, messages, and download updates and downloads remotely as well.
### Preparing USB Storage for Media and Saves
With a USB flash drive formatted to the FAT32 file system, you can wirelessly transfer saved games, screenshots, movies, music and more between the PS4 and mobile devices using Remote Play. Organize content into clearly named folders on the drive for smooth access away from the console.
## Getting the Most From Remote Play
### Improving WiFi Performance for Streaming
For the best Remote Play experience, use an Ethernet cable directly from the PS4 to the router whenever possible. If WiFi is necessary, use a dual-band router on the less-crowded 5GHz frequency for more stable streaming when away from home. 
### Pairing a DualShock Controller With Your Phone
For a more traditional control scheme when streaming away from the TV, pair a DualShock 4 controller directly to compatible Android and iOS devices running Remote Play. Hold the PS and Share buttons simultaneously on the controller until it blinks to enter pairing mode with the mobile device.
### Tips for Individual Games and Apps Support 
While many PS4 games can be controlled remotely, some work better than others depending on internet latency and control scheme. Research top titles optimized for Remote Play like **Horizon Zero Dawn**, **God of War**, and **Spider-Man** before streaming away from home.
## Conclusion
With PlayStation Remote Play, the PS4 gaming experience extends beyond the living room. Connect devices, set up networks, optimize performance, and explore supported features to start remotely accessing your console library from other rooms or on the go. Following these best practices ensures the smoothest experience no matter where life's adventures may take you next.
