## Secure Your PlayStation Account and Devices
With the rise in online threats and data breaches, it's crucial to regularly secure your PlayStation Network account and the devices linked to it. By remotely deactivating all linked PlayStation consoles and apps from your account settings, you can ensure your personal information and game library remain protected. This guide will walk through the simple steps to remotely deactivate your devices and help explain when and why it's beneficial to do this process.
### Remotely Deactivate Linked Devices from Your Account Settings 
Logging into your PlayStation Network account online and navigating to the "Account Settings" allows you full control over the devices connected to your account. **Locate the "Sign Out All Devices" option** within the section managing linked devices. Click or tap this button to instantly sign out all PlayStation consoles and apps currently signed into your PSN account from a remote location. Remotely deactivating devices in this manner provides an added layer of security when needed.

### Enhance Security by Changing Your PSN Password
For maximum protection of your account, **change your PSN password** in the security settings after signing out all linked devices. Choosing a new, unique password with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols helps prevent unauthorized access if your previous credentials were ever compromised. Regularly updating your password, especially when unlinking all devices, keeps your account and personal information secure.
### Reasons to Remotely Deactivate Your Devices
There are a few key reasons why regularly using the "Sign Out All Devices" feature provides benefits for managing your PSN account security and device usage. Some of the main reasons include:
### Securing Your Account When Selling or Upgrading Devices
Signing out all devices before selling or replacing a PlayStation console linked to your account ensures that the new owner cannot access your downloaded games, subscriptions, or personal data still tied to that system. This important step protects your account when transfering ownership of a device.
### Preventing Unauthorized Access on Compromised Devices 
If any devices previously linked to your PSN account are lost, stolen or the security is in question, remotely deactivating them prevents any potential unauthorized access to your account from that compromised system. The extra layer of removing active sessions keeps your credentials and profile more secure.
### Reinstating Your Primary Console Access
After signing out all devices for security purposes, you can easily sign back into your account on your personal systems. Be sure to reinstate one device as your "primary" console in order to restore access to your digital game library and subscriptions on that primary system.
## Frequently Resetting Device Links Keeps Your Account Secure
PlayStation Network policies state that the "Sign Out All Devices" option should only be used about once every 180 days to prevent any issues with your account. Too frequent use of this security feature could potentially trigger locks if it seems suspicious. Only utilize the remote device deactivation when truly needed, such as selling a system or addressing a specific security concern. Otherwise, leaving devices linked avoids unnecessary disruptions to your access. With regular password changes and periodic device resets according to the limits, you can proactively manage the security of your PlayStation account and the systems connected to your profile.
