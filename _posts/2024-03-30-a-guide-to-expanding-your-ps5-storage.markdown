### Introduction
The PS5 has a default storage capacity of 667GB, but this internal solid state drive (SSD) can fill up quickly as game sizes increase. Thankfully, Sony has provided options to **expand the storage capacity** beyond the internal SSD. This guide will outline the different methods and requirements for **adding more storage space** to your PS5.

### Running out of space is inevitable 
With some PS5 titles taking up **over 100GB of storage each**, it's inevitable that the standard 667GB of internal storage will fill up for most gamers. Larger next-gen titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Destiny 2 can easily consume half of the internal SSD storage alone. When you factor in installing multiple games, saving screenshots and footage, and needing room for game updates, you may find yourself with very little free space left on the internal drive sooner rather than later. 
### Using an external USB hard drive is a budget option
An external USB hard drive is the most affordable way to get **extra storage capacity** for your PS5 right away. Any external hard drive that uses USB 3.0 or later connections will work to store and backup PS5 and PS4 games. However, only PS4 games can be played directly from the external drive. PS5 games must first be transferred back to the internal SSD in order to play them since the external hard drive is too slow to run newer, larger games. While inexpensive, external hard drives also have significantly slower load times than the internal SSD or expanded M.2 storage.
### Installing an internal M.2 SSD delivers the best performance  
For those wanting **faster load speeds** and the ability to play PS5 games directly off of expanded storage, installing an internal M.2 solid state drive (SSD) is the best option. However, not just any M.2 SSD will work. It must meet Sony's strict requirements including supporting the PCIe Gen4 interface, having certain form factors, achieving minimum read speeds of 5,500MB/s, and including an adequate cooling solution like a heatsink. Meeting all the compatibility parameters **limits the choice of M.2 drives** but results in load times that rival or even surpass using just the internal SSD in some cases.
### Popular M.2 SSD options that meet Sony's standards
Some of the commonly recommended M.2 SSDs that are confirmed by reviewers and testing to satisfy the PS5's storage expansion requirements include:
- **Seagate FireCuda 530**: available in capacities up to 2TB, this M.2 NVMe SSD delivers read/write speeds over 7,000/5,000 MB/s. 
- **Samsung 980 Pro**: read/write speeds up to 7,000/5,100 MB/s from this PCIe 4.0 M.2 drive make it a top choice. Capacities range from 250GB up to 2TB.
- **WD_Black SN850**: Western Digital's PCIe 4.0 SSD boasts up to 7,000/5,300 MB/s transfer rates with versions offering 1TB or 2TB of storage space.
All three **high-performance M.2 SSD options** are in the $200-350 price range depending on capacity but provide greatly boosted load times compared to external USB hard drives or using just the internal SSD alone.
### Installing an M.2 drive requires care and proper cooling 
Installing an M.2 SSD into the expansion slot of the PS5 is a simple yet potentially risky process if not done carefully. Proper safety handling of components is essential along with making sure any required heatsinks are securely attached before mounting the drive. The steps to install are:
1. Power down and unplug the PS5 from any power source. 
2. Remove the side cover plate to access the expansion bay. 
3. Attach included heatsinks (if needed) to the M.2 drive. 
4. Carefully insert the M.2 SSD at a 30-degree angle into the expansion slot. 
5. Secure it with the included screw then replace the cover plate.
Photos of each installation step help visualize the process and ensure every precaution is taken to avoid damage to components from static discharge during drive swapping.
### Formatting and transferring games to expanded storage
Once installed, you'll need to manually **initialize and format the M.2 SSD** through the PS5 system software before it can be used. Go to Settings > Storage and select 'Format as Extended Storage' for the drive to be recognized. Then you can use the 'Transfer to/from Extended Storage' option to easily move supported PS5 and PS4 games between the internal SSD and expanded M.2 drive as needed based on what titles you're currently playing. This allows making the most of total console storage between the drives.
### Conclusion 
In conclusion, the PS5's default internal SSD fills up faster than anticipated for most gamers. Thankfully there are options for **increasing storage capacity** including using an external USB hard drive or investing in a compatible internal M.2 SSD expansion. While external drives offer low cost storage, only an M.2 SSD provides load time improvements and the ability to directly run PS5 titles off expanded storage. Choosing one of the highest rated PCIe Gen 4 M.2 options strikes the best balance of performance and value for serious PS5 players looking to maximize their console's storage. This guide aimed to help inform the process of selecting and installing expanded storage customized to individual needs and budgets.
