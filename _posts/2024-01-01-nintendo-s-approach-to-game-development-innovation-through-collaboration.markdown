### Internal Studios Lead the Way
Nintendo has several in-house development studios, collectively known as Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development (Nintendo EPD), that handle the bulk of first-party game development. The largest of these include **Nintendo Research & Development 1** (R&D1), **Nintendo Research & Development 2** (R&D2), and Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD). Together, these internal studios steer the direction of Nintendo's software and are responsible for beloved franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Pok√©mon.

### Trusted Partners Extend Nintendo's Reach  
In addition to internal teams, Nintendo leverages strategic partnerships with experienced external developers. Studios like **Monolith Soft** and **Next Level Games** work exclusively with Nintendo to bring their visions to life. Monolith Soft is renowned for the Xenoblade Chronicles series while Next Level Games specializes in Mario sports titles. By empowering trusted partners, Nintendo ensures top-quality games across multiple genres.
### Expanding with Proposed Ideas
Some developers actively pitch new concepts to Nintendo using their intellectual properties (IPs). Past successes include **F-Zero GX** from Sega and **Metroid: Samus Returns** from MercurySteam. By fielding outside proposals, Nintendo discovers fresh takes that expand their franchises in surprising directions. Both of these games went on to receive critical acclaim.
### Initiating Key Relationships  
Nintendo is not afraid to approach external talent either. They tapped Bandai Namco to develop the popular **Super Smash Bros.** series and brought in Capcom to revive the **Metroid Prime** sub-series. More recently, MercurySteam was commissioned for the acclaimed **Metroid Dread**. By kickstarting projects with partners, Nintendo ensures their marquee franchises remain in capable hands.
### Support from Subsidiaries  
Nintendo owns two dedicated subsidiaries that provide complementary services. Nintendo European Research & Development (NERD) focuses on hardware R&D while Nintendo Software Technology (NST) focuses on engineering tools and middleware technologies. Together, these subsidiaries underpin Nintendo's platform capabilities.
### Acquisitions Strengthen Expertise
Over time, Nintendo has expanded their internal capabilities through selective acquisitions. Purchasing **Monolith Soft** in 2007 gave them a stronghold in role-playing games. Adding **Next Level Games** in 2020 added expertise in multiplayer online games. Such strategic acquisitions allow Nintendo to develop new genres internally with inherited specialist skills.
### Guiding a Publishing Portfolio  
In some cases, Nintendo funds external developers to create games based on their IPs but publishes the finished products themselves. Recent examples include **Luigi's Mansion 3** and **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**. This publishing model gets quality experiences in the hands of fans while maintaining oversight of the Nintendo brand.
### Innovation Beyond Hardware
While often portrayed as graphically inferior, Nintendo innovates elsewhere. Their consoles prioritize novel **controllers** and **gameplay mechanics** that immerse players in unique worlds. The Nintendo Switch demonstrated this approach could translate to hybrid formats. By thinking differently, Nintendo stays relevant through memorable experiences rather than raw specs.
### Lasting Impact and Inspiration
Beyond commercially successful games and consoles, Nintendo shapes the industry through the visionaries behind them. Figures like **Shigeru Miyamoto** redefine player interaction and storytelling. Over decades, Nintendo has established itself as the gold standard in video game development that developers continue drawing influence from. Their innovations ensure Nintendo's influence will carry gaming into the future.
