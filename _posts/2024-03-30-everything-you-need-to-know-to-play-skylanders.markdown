### Do you really need a starter pack?
While starter packs are commonly marketed as essential to start playing any Skylanders game, the truth is you have more options. For new games, starter packs do include the all-important portal of power needed to bring Skylanders figures to life in the game, along with 3-4 starting characters and a full copy of the game. However, for existing Skylanders fans looking to dive into a new installment, **portal owner packs** provide just the game and 1-2 starting figures for a lower price point. As long as you already own a compatible portal from a previous game, these packs allow you to jump right in without buying duplicated items.

### Compatible portals and what you need for each game
At its core, all you truly need to play any Skylanders game is a **compatible portal of power**, at least one Skylanders figure character, and a copy of the corresponding video game title. The portals connect the physical toy figures to the digital worlds and gameplay. While early titles required game-specific portals, later installments like Trap Team introduced portals that remain forward and backward compatible across all games. For console versions, you'll need the proprietary portal for that system, such as the Xbox or PlayStation models. But the versatile Trap Team portal works across consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices.
### Spyro's Adventure: Kick starting the original trilogy  
Released in 2011, **Spyro's Adventure** launched the Skylanders franchise and set the stage for its interactive toys-to-life concept. To start your adventure, all you needed was the game, a portal, and any single Series 1 Skylanders figure with a green detection base. These early figures featured Spyro the dragon, Gill Grunt, Trigger Happy and more. Playing through the game's colorful worlds just required using one figure at a time, making it an accessible starting point whether playing on your own or with young gamers.
### Giants: Expanding the realms with larger-than-life characters
In 2012, **Giants** took things to an epic new level by introducing the bigger-bodied Giant class of Skylanders. This sequel added new layers of strategy and teamwork by requiring players to use both a standard Skylander and a Giant character simultaneously. While veterans likely had their pick of standard figures, newcomers just needed a leftover Series 1 figure and either a Series 2 regular or a Giant like Tree Rex or Thumpback to see the expanded story. Thanks to backwards compatibility, Giants remained playable even after subsequent releases changed the formula further.
### Swap Force: The ability to customize combos
The innovative **Swap Force** iteration in 2013 took customization to new heights by letting players build their own hybrid Skylanders. These dual-bodied figures featured magnets at the waist, allowing their two halves to be freely swapped between different characters. This twist demanded at least one full Swap Force Skylander that could be physically combined in new configurations. Beyond providing variety, these frankensteined figures gained unique abilities from their components. It was a novel new dimension for the toys that translated seamlessly into new depths of gameplay.
### Trap Team: Capturing villains for later usage
Building upon the previous releases, 2014's **Trap Team** introduced trapping as a core pillar. It required players to first obtain one or more Trap Masters, special variant figures featuring a built-in crystal trap. These champions could then be used within the game to capture villainous foes like Kaos and his underlings. Once caught, these baddies joined your collection and became playable Skylanders themselves under certain conditions. While trapping them was optional, a Trap Master served as a necessity to proceed through the storyline. Their unique abilities also opened new areas of each hub world.
### SuperChargers: Vehicle-powered racing adventures 
Taking things in an all-new direction, 2015's **SuperChargers** broke the mold by adding vehicles into the equation. This iteration leaned into land and aerial racing across various fantasy terrains and arenas. On home consoles, any regular Skylander could tag along for vehicle levels, but simply piloting a land SuperCharger vehicle would suffice for the main campaign. However, for versions on Nintendo 3DS and mobile devices, possessing at least one flying SuperCharger became a must since exploration focused on aerial dogfights and sky courses. Either way, the vehicle/character combos brought a fresh twist that appealed to racing fans of all ages.
### Imaginators: Build your own heroes from scratch
As the most recent primary release in 2016, **Skylanders Imaginators** took the customization aspect further than ever before by empowering players as creators. For the first time, you didn't need any preexisting Skylanders figures - just one starter Imaginator would let you begin designing characters from the ground up. From choosing abilities and elements to aesthetics, you had unlimited agency over your unique toys and their digital gameplay counterparts. While extra figures provided bonus perks like increased level caps, a single homemade hero was all the game required to start your customized quest. It proved a fitting evolution for the toys-to-life genre pioneered by Skylanders.
