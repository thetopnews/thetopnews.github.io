### Introduction
Coelacanths were thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs over 65 million years ago. However, **in 1938 one of these ancient "lobe-finned fish" was caught off the coast of South Africa, showing they still existed**. Only two species are known to exist today, living in depths of up to 2,300 feet in the Indian Ocean—one near the Comoros Islands and Mozambique Channel, the other near Sulawesi, Indonesia. Their existence as **"living fossils"** has fascinated scientists in understanding vertebrate evolution over hundreds of millions of years.

### Physical Characteristics and Anatomy
Adult coelacanths can reach over six feet and weigh up to 200 pounds, protected by thick scaly armor. They use **four fleshy arched fins** that move in an alternating pattern to navigate the ocean depths. Coelacanths have a unique **intracranial joint** allowing their mouths to open extremely wide, enabling them to consume large prey like fish and squid. Their most distinguishing anatomical feature is the notochord—a hollow, pressurized tube serving as the primitive backbone found in their ancient lobe-finned fish ancestors.
### Behavior and Deep Sea Habitat
Coelacanths are nocturnal predators, resting alone or in small groups during the day in caves and crevices on the reef at depths up to 2,300 feet. At dusk they slowly drift through the water column, using their keen senses to forage on small fish, squid, and crustaceans up to eight kilometers from their rocky daytime shelters. They employ **electroreception** in their rostral organ and lateral line to stealthily hunt on the dark sea floor in the abyssal zone. 
### Rare Livebirth Reproduction
Female coelacanths have an extraordinary gestation period, carrying their rare live young internally for an estimated 13 months to three years—the longest such period for any fish species. Scientists believe only one or two offspring are birthed at a time, weighing around 500 grams. This extremely lengthy gestation is thought to be an evolutionary holdover from the transition of coelacanths' ancestors from fish to land-living animals that developed in the womb for extended periods.
### Population Status and Conservation Threats
The West Indian Ocean coelacanth population numbers only around 500 individuals and is classified as **Critically Endangered** by the IUCN due to habitat loss from destructive bottom trawling by fisheries. Some coelacanths are unintentionally captured as fisheries bycatch and removed from the gene pool. Their population does not appear to be self-sustaining without protection. The Indonesian population remains even more elusive with numbers unknown but believed to be smaller still. Improved understanding of these rare populations through additional research is critical for effective long-term conservation strategies. 
### Understanding the Fish-to-Tetrapod Transition
As the only surviving lineage of lobe-finned fish, coelacanths offer scientists a unique window into the appearance and characteristics of the earliest terrestrial vertebrates that evolved from fish over 350 million years ago. Studying elements of their biochemistry, neurological system, muscle development, and locomotion aids in understanding the crucial evolutionary transition of tetrapods (four-limbed creatures) like modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
### Potential for Future Discoveries
With less than 20 percent of the global ocean explored, the possibility remains that additional coelacanth populations may still exist undiscovered in other deeper regions like the western Pacific or eastern coasts of Africa. Advances in genetic testing of market fish samples and deploying deep-diving autonomous underwater vehicles and submersibles may help uncover new insights into the diversity, distribution, and biology of these strange survivors from the ancient seas that continue to fascinate scientists today.
### Conclusion 
After millions of years believed extinct, the twentieth century discovery of living coelacanths challenged what we knew about evolution and the history of life on our planet. As rare ancient relics existing in the most extreme environments on Earth, coelacanths deserve the highest levels of conservation to safeguard these remarkable living fossils for future generations. Continued research may yet uncover more about these deep sea denizens and the mysterious transition of vertebrates from seas to land so long ago.
