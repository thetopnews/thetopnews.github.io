## The Epic Games Store Was Giving Away Popular Titles to Drive User Growth 
Epic Games has found success in attracting new users to their digital storefront by periodically offering highly sought-after games completely free of charge. Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) was one such blockbuster title that was freely available for a limited window. By generously handing out a game as renowned as GTA 5, Epic aimed to entice curious gamers into creating Epic accounts and downloading their launcher client.
### **Rockstar's Beloved Open-World Crime Franchise**
Developed by Rockstar North and first released way back in 2013, **GTA 5** continues to be immensely popular nearly a decade later thanks to its sprawling and living recreations of Los Angeles and San Andreas. Players take on the roles of three very different criminals - Franklin, Michael, and Trevor - across a gripping single-player story and the massively expansive world of online multiplayer. With its stylish heists, signature humor, and total freedom to hijack vehicles or cause chaos however you desire, **GTA 5's** virtual sandbox remains unmatched in scope and detail. No wonder Epic saw it as the perfect title to introduce to new users through an attention-grabbing free promotion.

### Download and Install the Epic Games Store Application  
Before being able to access and install any free games offered on their store, users need to acquire the Epic Games Launcher software. This can be readily obtained by visiting https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/ and clicking the "Download" button associated with your PC's operating system - whether that's Windows, Mac, or Linux. Once downloaded, simply run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to set up your Epic account during the lightweight setup process.
### Claiming Grand Theft Auto V During the Promotion Window
With the Epic Games Launcher freshly installed, eligible users then navigated to the prominent carousel on the store's homepage spotlighting the current free titles. During GTA 5's promotion period, its standard $60 price tag would be struck through and replaced with a bold "GET" call-to-action button. By clicking this, the full game was permanently tied to their Epic account at no cost. But timing was of the essence, as the offer expired after roughly two weeks.
### Downloading Dozens of Gigabytes of Game Files  
The immense 75+ GB size of **GTA 5** meant it could take well over an hour to completely download over a decent broadband connection. Thankfully, the Epic Games Launcher supported pausing/resuming downloads, so claiming the free copy didn't necessitate sitting and actively monitoring the process the whole time. Periodic speed checks also ensured maximum throughput. Once finished downloading, Epic then prompted installation of the large game package onto your target drive.
### ### Installing Rockstar's Social Club Platform
While the core game downloaded and installed through Epic, **GTA 5** requires association with Rockstar's Social Club service for certain online features and account verification. Therefore, upon first launch a prompt guided users through installing this additional Rockstar Games Launcher application. Choose a custom install location matching your Epic download folder to avoid potential issues with file discrepancies later on.  
### Completing the Installation Process
With both the game and Rockstar software installed, it was time for some final configuration steps. First, sign into your existing or create a new Rockstar Social Club account. Then link this profile to your matching Epic account ID for cross-platform recognition moving forward. Finally, locate and launch Grand Theft Auto V from the Epic Games library to dive into the acclaimed open-world mayhem!
### Introduction to GTA Online: The Blockbuster Online Component   
While the single-player storyline provided dozens of hours of criminal escapades, **GTA 5** truly shone in its robust online multiplayer mode, **GTA Online**. This ever-evolving game world allows players to engage in cooperative Heists, competitive Deathmatches and Races, or simply explore San Andreas freely with friends. New features and content are regularly added by Rockstar to keep the action fresh. With its own massive player base and economy, **GTA Online** has essentially become a game in its own right seven years later.
### The Unlikely Possibility of a Second Free Promotion 
Given how strategically timed and limited the initial free offering of **GTA 5** was through Epic, industry analysts maintain it's improbable the store will replicate this massive promotion again anytime soon. As one of the best-selling entertainment titles of all time, handing it out for a second stint does not align with Epic's roadmap to continuously court new customers. That said, regular discounts during seasonal sales events offer slightly more affordable alternatives for the game down the line compared to full price.
### Alternative Ways to Access GTA 5 Going Forward
With the shiny new "free" label gone, interested players still have alternative avenues to experience Rockstar's acclaimed crime simulator. The most straightforward is to purchase a full-priced digital copy direct through Steam or Epic during occasional discounts. Alternatively, second-hand physical discs can sometimes be found cheaply from online resellers or local used game shops. As a last resort, rental subscriptions provide temporary access for a low monthly fee if only wanting to play the campaign rather than long-term.
### In Conclusion
By boldly making Grand Theft Auto V freely available to claim on their platform, Epic Games pulled off a digital marketing feat that drove millions of new installs of their launcher. While unlikely to reoccur anytime soon, this unprecedented promotion for one of gaming's most successful series undoubtedly accomplished Epic's goals of growing awareness and trial of their fledgling storefront. Those who took advantage back then now have one of the best open-world experiences of all time in their permanent game libraries, thanks to Epic's temporary act of generous gaming munificence.
