## Introduction
The Nintendo Switch has become a hugely popular gaming system for both solo and family fun alike. One of its best features is the ability to share digital games between multiple Switch consoles through the family account system. However, navigating the ins and outs of family sharing can be convoluted. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain everything you need to know about setting up and using **game sharing across multiple Nintendo Switch systems in a household**.
### Setting Up Family Sharing
To begin sharing games, the first step is setting your Nintendo Switch console to parental controls or "family mode". Open the system settings menu and select "Users" then "Add New User" to add any additional accounts for family members. 
Once all accounts are added, you'll need to designate a "Parent/Guardian" as the primary account. Only this primary account can manage family members and adjust parental control settings. Next, link the family members' accounts by selecting "Link Nintendo Account" for each user. 
Finally, enable family group features in your Nintendo Account profile on nintendo.com. Here you can view linked consoles and designate one as the "primary" system while others will be marked "secondary". **A Nintendo Switch Online family membership is required to access online services across accounts.**

## Sharing Retail Games  
Retail games purchased as physical cartridges have some restrictions for sharing. The **game cartridge can only be played by one Nintendo Switch system at a time.** Whichever console has the game card inserted is the only Switch that can launch and play the title. 
Additionally, only the primary account holder, not secondary family members, can earn coins or redeem rewards like gold points from playing a retail game. So for simultaneous multiplayer, you'll need multiple game cards if playing across different consoles.
## Sharing Digital Downloads
Digital games downloaded to the system's memory have more flexible sharing capabilities compared to physical cartridges. However, there are still some guidelines to keep in mind:
### Primary vs Secondary Systems
A Nintendo Switch must be designated as either the "primary" or "secondary" console within a family group. The primary system can run any digital games purchased by the parent account offline or online without logging into the purchasing account. 
Meanwhile, secondary Switches require the purchasing account to be **logged into Nintendo eShop and connected to the internet each time a shared digital title is launched.**
### Simultaneous Play Restrictions 
While a digital game can be shared across multiple systems, it cannot be actively played simultaneously across the consoles. Only one secondary Switch can access a purchased digital title at a time when the primary console is offline or playing a different game.
### Internet Connection Requirements
As mentioned, secondary consoles accessing shared digital games will need to verify the account's license by checking into Nintendo's servers periodically. If the internet drops while playing, the software may exit until it can re-verify. Reliable WiFi is important for seamless shared digital gaming on secondary Switches.
## Managing Online Play Across Accounts
When launching a digital game on a secondary Switch while signed into the purchasing account, an internet connection is required not just for launching but also when switching user profiles within the software. This allows properly authenticating each family member to access online modes.
However, this constant need to reconnect when toggling between profiles can cause disruptions. It's a more cumbersome process than systems like Xbox Live that treat the whole family group as a single unit online. The Switch's method of verifying each individual account risks kicking players back to the title menu if the connection stutters. 
Thankfully, most first-party Nintendo titles like **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros Ultimate** handle online smoothly across profiles once they've launched. But third-party multiplayer games may have more issues keeping groups together seamlessly when flipping between family member accounts. Reliable internet is key for lag-free online family fun.
## Top Family-Friendly Game Recommendations
With family sharing configured, it's time to discover great games to bring your household together. The ever-popular Mario franchise is a safe bet, with classics like:
### Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
This iconic kart racer supports screens both online and off with enjoyable racing across cups and battle modes. Up to 8 consoles can connect for wireless local multiplayer too. 
### Super Mario Party 
A party game filled with classic board game style mini-games that are simple to learn but hard to master. Supports online play with Nintendo Switch Online.
For cooperative co-op adventures, try **Luigi's Mansion 3**. Players work together suctioning ghosts while exploring haunted mansions stuffed with puzzles and secrets. It also features online competitive multiplayer modes for all ages.
Two indie darlings that are a blast for groups are **Overcooked** and **Overcooked 2**. These frantic cooking simulator games task teams with chopping ingredients and rushing meals out to hungry customers - all while fires rage and obstacles abound. The challenge of perfectly timing teamwork makes these crowd-pleasers. 
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a must-have for fighting game fans both casual and competitive. Its enormous roster of recognizable characters ensures entertainment for players young and old. Online modes like battles and tournaments keep this one exciting for the whole family for a long time.
## Finding Great Deals on Family Games
With so many excellent options, you may find yourself with a lengthy wishlist of family titles to try. Thankfully, the Nintendo eShop frequently features sales across both first and third-party games. Be sure to regularly check the "Great Deals" section for discounts up to 75% off titles.
While core Mario, Zelda and Pokemon games rarely see price drops, supporting franchises and indie hits cycle through sales more often. Keep an eye out especially for multiplayer indies like **Overcooked which may fall to $5-10 during big seasonal sales**. Physical used games from retailers can offer cheaper entry points too for less popular older releases.
Subscribing to Nintendo's email newsletter also helps ensure you don't miss out on limited-time deals across various genres. Family games that fly under the radar like BoxBoy! + BoxGirl are perfect for knocking off your digital wishlist on a budget.
## Conclusion  
Setting up family sharing allows Nintendo Switch households to enjoy a versatile library of classics and hidden gems together. While the process of designating primary/secondary systems and periodically checking internet connections takes some configuration, it ultimately provides a flexible way to experience great games across the home. 
Remember that retail cartridges can only be played one at a time, but digital downloads unlock a world of shared multiplayer fun when set up properly. Taking the time to learn the ins and outs now will lead to countless gaming memories made with loved ones down the road. Happy gaming!
