### Turn Your PC On and Off from the Comfort of Your Couch
Plug your Xbox One controller into your PC with a USB cable and it can wake your computer from sleep or shut it down with the press of a button. Many modern motherboards and BIOS settings support waking the system from a suspended state when a USB device sends a signal. With the right settings enabled, your controller can serve as a **remote power switch** for seamless on-demand gaming from across the room.

### Play all Your Favorite Games with Plug-and-Play Support  
Whether you're jumping back into an old classic or diving into the latest blockbuster release, the Xbox One controller gives you the smoothest gaming experience possible when directly connected to your PC. Simply plug the controller into an open USB port with the included USB-A to USB-C cable and Windows will immediately recognize it. No laggy wireless connection or additional software required - just plug and play thousands of games with **plug-and-play gamepad support**.
### Take Your Wireless Gaming On the Go with Bluetooth
While a wired connection gives you the lowest latency, a wireless option gives you freedom of movement. Pair your Xbox One controller to your PC's built-in Bluetooth adapter using the Xbox Accessories app for lag-free wireless play up to 30 feet away. Once paired, it connects automatically every time, so you can kick back on the couch or even take your controller with you around the house for impromptu sessions of **wireless on-the-go gaming**. 
### Use Voice Commands to Start Your Games from Any Room  
Wouldn't it be nice to start up your games or shut down your PC without getting off the couch? Smart outlets and infrared remote controls let you control your PC digitally from a distance. Plug your computer into a smart plug then use voice commands with Alexa or Google Assistant to remotely turn it on and launch your games with just your voice. Never get up for boring shutdowns either - tell your virtual assistant to put your PC to sleep from the other side of the home for true **hands-free convenience**.
### Rediscover Your Favorite Xbox and Xbox 360 Classics 
Even games from past console generations can enjoy new life on PC thanks to emulation tools like Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. Experience fan-favorite Xbox and Xbox 360 titles on your computer with genuine Xbox controller support for the authentic console feel. Revisit old friends with higher resolutions and frame rates or shorter load times. Make discovering your retro library of **classic console gems** as easy and enjoyable as possible.
### Customize Your Controls for a Perfect Fit  
The Xbox Accessories app gives you complete customization over every button, trigger, and stick on your Xbox One controller. Create specific profiles for each game you play and tailor every input to your liking. Rearrange buttons, assign functions to triggers or bumpers, modify stick and D-pad sensitivity. Ensure the perfect control scheme for each genre and game with personalized **customizable button mapping**.
### Troubleshoot Connectivity Issues on the Spot
Even the most reliable hardware can run into hiccups now and then. If your controller suddenly disconnects during gameplay or feels laggy and unresponsive, the Xbox Accessories app and its built-in troubleshooting can often solve connection woes. Update your controller's firmware, try different USB ports, or replace a worn cable to restore gaming bliss. Rare problemsmay also stem from incompatibility or hardware failure, but the app helps pinpoint such issues fast to get you playing again with minimal downtime. With a bit of testing and trial-and-error, the app empowers you to take control of ** connectivity troubleshooting**.
### Expand Your Entertainment with Non-Gaming Apps  
While PC gaming with an Xbox controller provides an ultra-smooth experience, don't forget about all the other uses your gamepad enables as well. Browse the web or YouTube with your favorite device in hand. Navigate photo imports and slideshows. Control music and video playback. Even use voice commands on the controller for total hands-free media control. The convenience and reliability of your trusted Xbox One controller extends far beyond just games to revolutionize **all-in-one home entertainment**.
