## Part 1 - Introduction to PS5 Games
The PlayStation 5 allows for both physical disc-based games as well as downloaded digital titles. All games, whether from a disc or downloaded, require installation on the PS5's ultra-fast solid state drive (SSD) for optimized performance. This installation process extracts and prepares game files and resources needed to play. 
### Getting to Know PS5 Game Installs
With the PS5's **lightning-fast SSD**, installing games is a breeze compared to past console generations. Whether inserting a disc or selecting a digital title from the PlayStation store, games will only take a few minutes to fully install. This installation extracts all necessary game assets, levels, textures and more directly to the internal SSD for near instant loading.

### Physical Disc vs Digital Downloads 
There are some key differences between physical **disc-based games** and digital downloads on PS5. Discs are used to initially install the core game files and act as verification of game ownership. However, once installed, the disc is only needed to boot up and verify the game - core gameplay does not require the disc. Digital downloads operate similarly after initial installation, with no disc needed. Both options allow for future game and asset downloads as needed.
## Part 2 - Getting the Most from PS5 with Used and Retail Games
### Buying Physical Disc Games 
Opting for physical game discs provides some advantages on PS5. Discs can be found new or used at affordable prices from major retailers and online marketplaces. This provides flexibility to try more games without large upfront costs. Used discs also allow games to be traded in, borrowed or resold once completed. 
### Game Resale and Rental Options
Because physical discs maintain resellable value, many gamers enjoy trading titles they've completed for others. Popular games also become available to rent from video stores, libraries or services like GameFly. Renting is a cost effective way **to demo games before purchasing** and experience many titles for a low monthly fee.
### Sharing Disc-Based Games 
Physical games on PS5 open the doors for sharing options not available digitally. Discs can be loaned or borrowed by friends locally. Multi-disc games may even be shared digitally through the PS5's game sharing functionality once installed. This social experience adds more flexibility and value compared to single-user digital licenses.
### Accessing DLC and Updates
Although the disc is only needed at startup, it remains the key to accessing add-on downloadable content (DLC) and feature updates. Season passes, character/map packs and more purchased for a disc game will still be tied to that specific title. Day one patches and later compatibility updates also require the original game disc.
## Part 3 - The Benefits of All-Digital Gaming  
### Convenience of Downloading Games  
Digital game downloads cut out the need to find physical media and provide a convenient way to build a game library. During sales and with a PlayStation Plus subscription, the cost of many titles can be less than retail too. Downloading games is as easy as navigating an online storefront.
### Quickly Switch Between Games
Jumping between multiple games is a breeze with an all-digital setup. No more swapping discs or keeping physical cases organized - just select any installed game from the quick menu or home screen instantly. Storage space can be managed by deleting older completed games as well. 
### Streamlined Access Across Devices  
With a PlayStation Network account, downloaded digital games are accessible on multiple consoles through logins. Got a new PS5? Just sign in and re-download favorites from the cloud. Mobile remote play even provides on-the-go access to the full library. Managing one centralized digital library provides flexibility.
### Easy Access to Add-On Content  
Like physical discs, digitally downloaded games are tied to a single PlayStation Network account. However, add-ons, DLC and other in-game purchases are stored against this account rather than a disc title. This allows bonus content to be re-downloaded freely without the original game disc.
## Part 4 - Backwards Compatibility and PS4 Game Upgrades  
### PlayStation 4 Compatibility  
Sony's implementation of backwards compatibility on the PS5 goes above and beyond what gamers expected. Nearly the entire library of over 4000 PlayStation 4 titles work without issues on the more powerful hardware. Popular exclusives like **God of War** and **Horizon Zero Dawn** shine with a graphical boost. 
### Free Upgrades for Top PS4 Games
Some of the highest profile PS4 games received free next-gen upgrades, including **Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales** and **Ghost of Tsushima**. These utilize the full power of the PS5 to double framerates, add ray-tracing for more realistic lighting and environments, and incorporate loading optimizations for near-instant level streaming.  
### Minor Restrictions on PS4 Downloads  
A small percentage of downloadable PS4 games lack compatibility, often indie or niche titles. Disc-based games without a digital version may also require the original PS4 disc for installation. A tiny handful of pre-order bonuses, betas or demos are disabled as well. However, the PS5 covers backwards compatibility exceptionally well overall.
### Leverage DualSense in Legacy Games 
While not fully utilized, some PS4 games take advantage of the DualSense controller's **adaptive triggers and haptic feedback**. Games like **Spider-Man Remastered** add subtle vibration effects during web-swinging that immerse players further in familiar experiences. Future patches may expand DualSense features in more legacy games too.
## Part 5 - Researching Game Compatibility 
### Check on a Title-by-Title Basis
Due to the vast number of games, it's always best to research individual titles rather than assume full compatibility. Simple online searches for "Game Title PS5" will quickly reveal upgrade notes, issues reported, or confirmation that a game runs issue-free on Sony's new hardware. 
### Sony's Official Backwards Compatibility List  
For an "official" overview, Sony maintains a running list on the PlayStation site of tested and confirmed backwards compatible games. While most work transparently, some may have erratic behavior requiring patches. The list provides a baseline for known compatible experiences.
### Community Reviews and Forums  
Beyond direct developer info, game communities online can offer valuable user-reported details. Subreddits, blogs and forums track post-launch experiences that aren't always documented officially at launch. Peer-reviewed feedback highlights anything from minor glitches to game-breaking problems worth avoiding until patches. 
### Don't Fully Rely on PS4 Discs  
Whie the overwhelming library works, not every PS4 disc games runs install-free on PS5 without the original disc. Some, like special editions, may rely on long-lost online codes no longer redeemable too. Keep older PS4 hardware if solely dependent on niche titles that haven't been upgraded fully.
## Part 6 - Choosing Your PS5 Game Setup
### Balance Physical and Digital Needs  
There is no definitive "best" format - choose what complements gaming habits and budgets. A mix of both physical and digital games maximizes value as discs can be borrowed/resold while convenient downloads offer sales. An external USB drive supplements storage for disc installs too.
### Consider a Game Subscription  
Services like PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now provide affordable access to hundreds of games each month across generations for a low monthly fee. This removes upfront costs and opens many worlds to sample before committing longer-term. 
### Research Top Retailers and Used Game Stores
Major stores offer promotions, loyalty points and warranty options on software. However, independent shops maintain used game collections perfect for discovering hidden gems affordably. Online auction sites also supply hard-to-find titles at fair prices.
### Plan for Future-Proofing Your Library  
New platforms will come, as will new features on PlayStation Plus making past games available again. Keep an eye out for forwards-compatible titles that maintain value across generations wherever possible to maximize the lifespan of your investment in gaming.
