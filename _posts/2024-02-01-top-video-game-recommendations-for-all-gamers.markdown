## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in some of the best video games out there. In this article, I will be sharing my personal top recommendations based on enjoyment and memorable experiences with each title. I have grouped them into different genre categories to hopefully find something for all types of gamers. Read on for game descriptions and what makes each a must-play in their own right.
## Action-Adventure Games 
### **Open World Adventures: Far Cry Blood Dragon and Mad Max**
Far Cry Blood Dragon takes you back to the 1980s with its outstanding **retro futuristic setting**. Laser shooting dinosaurs and an amazing disco soundtrack make this a truly unique first person shooter experience. What really stands out though is the **memorable dialogue** that epitomizes the tongue-in-cheek tone and humor throughout the game. 
Mad Max finally brought an **open world adaptation of the iconic post-apocalyptic films** to life. Building up your car, known as the Magnum Opus, and engaging in intense vehicular combat across the desert wasteland was extremely satisfying. The beautifully desolate world begs to be explored, and there is a great sense of progression as you gain more abilities and upgrades over the lengthy playtime.

### **The Dark Knight Rises: Batman: Arkham City** 
Batman: Arkham City improved upon its predecessor in many ways. Featuring the memorable characters of Batman, The Joker, and new additions like Catwoman and Hugo Strange, the plotline was captivating from start to finish. Advanced combat, ever-expanding gadgets, and epic boss fights made it a thrill to take down evildoers as the Caped Crusader. While the ending was enticing, I won't give it away - you'll have to play to experience that memorable conclusion.
## Shooter Games
### **Co-Op Chaos: Borderlands 2 and Splinter Cell Blacklist**
Gearbox knows how to kick off a game in style, and Borderlands 2 grabbed your attention immediately with its humorous opening and enduring characters like the annoying but endearing Claptrap. Repetitive combat is made fun through cooperative online play and the thrill of finding increasingly powerful loot.
Splinter Cell Blacklist presents Sam Fisher as a formidable agent with multiple ways to covertly accomplish objectives. Solo stealth or all-out assault are both viable options thanks to well-designed levels. The gripping plot keeps you engaged from mission to mission as well. Co-op modes are also highly enjoyable experiences with a friend.
### **Bioshock Infinite: A Mind-Blowing Masterpiece** 
Considered by many to be the best first person shooter of its generation, Bioshock Infinite is memorable from start to unexpected finish. The sky-city of Columbia is unlike any game setting before, and traveling between areas via sky-hook is exhilarating. An arsenal of retro futuristic weapons and enemy "vigors" makes combat constantly exciting and strategic. Those expecting just another shooter will be blown away by the deeply thought-provoking storyline and shocking plot twists.
## Action-Adventure/Role Playing Hybrids
### **The Witcher 3: Game of the Decade**
As the conclusion to Geralt's saga, The Witcher 3 not only fulfilled the multi-path story fans had followed for years, but expanded the playable world and characters tenfold from previous entries. With hundreds of hours of content, gamers got their money's worth in the vast open world of diverse environments. Tactical first-person melee combat remains challenging throughout, and the 16 free DLC expansions took the experience to a whole new level. It's easy to see why this game is hailed as the definitive RPG of the past decade.
### **Mafia II and Assassin's Creed Rogue: Underappreciated Gems**  
Taking place in the eras of 1940s-50s America, Mafia II immersed players in its phenomenal atmosphere of the Italian-American crime syndicate. Vito Scaletta's rise through the family with memorable supporting characters made it a journey fans are still awaiting a worthy sequel to continue.  
While often overlooked between major Assassin's Creed installments, Rogue took risks by having players experience the other side as a Templar. With the return of epic ship-based combat improving upon Black Flag, this offered a unique twist on the franchise's core mechanics. Both are examples of games that surpassed their expectations.
## Third Person Shooters
### **Max Payne 3: A Gripping Neo-Noir Story**
Rockstar vividly brought Max Payne's dark and tragedy-filled world to stunning new heights with the polished Max Payne 3. While part action shooter, its true strengths were the gripping noir storyline and Max's further descent into an alcoholic, pill-popping shell of his former self. His troubled journey in the vibrant but dangerous streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil gave this tired genre a fresh coat of paint fans happily embraced.
### **Conclusion** 
This covers some of the most memorable action, shooter and RPG titles that defined the past generation for me. Whether you prefer open worlds, co-op mayhem, mind-bending narratives or gritty crime stories, I hope this list sparked some game discovery you can spend dozens or hundreds of hours enjoying. As always, enjoy exploring these virtual worlds and don't hesitate to let me know if you have any other questions!
