The PlayStation 5 comes with only 825GB of internal SSD storage out of the box. While a sizable upgrade over the PlayStation 4, this limited capacity fills up quickly as game install sizes continue growing each year. Thankfully, Sony has provided several options for PS5 owners to expand their storage both internally and externally. This article will explore the different methods available now and in the future to increase PlayStation 5 storage capacity. 
## Part 1: Using External USB Hard Drives for PS4 Games
One of the simplest and most affordable options is using an external USB hard drive to store and play PS4 games. The PS5 allows USB 3.0 external hard drives to be connected and used to offload **PS4 games** from the internal SSD. While PS5 games must be installed internally, any PS4 titles can be transferred back and forth between the external drive and built-in storage as needed. This frees up precious SSD space internally while still allowing access to an immense library of classic PlayStation games. USB hard drives offer massive capacities up to 8TB or more, far eclipsing the internal storage limit.
## Part 2: Installing Fast NVMe SSD Expansion Drives 
For optimal performance with **next-generation PlayStation 5 games**, an NVMe SSD expansion card is preferable over an external hard drive. The PS5 supports M.2 drives that meet Sony's specifications for bandwidth and speed. While no officially licensed drives exist yet, this will change in the near future as drive manufacturers certify compatible models. Installing an external NVMe SSD allows moving PS5 games between it and the internal storage just like PS4 games on a USB drive. It also unleashes the full potential of the PS5's hardware with higher read/write speeds better utilizing the console's modern architecture.
## Part 3: Upgrading the Internal SSD Storage in the Coming Months
In a future system software update planned for later in 2022, Sony will unlock the ability to upgrade the internal SSD storage of the PS5. This will provide the fastest and most seamless expansion option yet. The PS5 has an empty internal M.2 slot that will support additional drives of up to 4TB in capacity. However, these large, high-speed NVMe SSDs will not be cheap, with prices currently ranging from $400-1000 depending on size and brand. But for those who can afford it, having a single large unified storage pool will be extremely convenient compared to juggling multiple external drives.
## Part 4: Workarounds Before the Internal SSD Upgrade Option
While waiting for Sony's internal SSD upgrade feature, some daring PS5 owners have attempted installing third-party M.2 drives themselves. However, this is not officially supported and could potentially void your warranty. The PS5 hasn't been unlocked yet to recognize any M.2 drive beyond its stock SSD. Significant technical know-how would also be required to perform the hardware modification and there is no guarantee an unofficial drive would even work properly. For now, it's best to avoid this risk and instead use external storage alternatives until Sony provides the intended expansion upgrade path later in 2022. 
## Part 5: Summary of Storage Expansion Options on PS5
In summary, PlayStation 5 owners have a few options today to expand limited storage:
- External USB hard drives to store **PS4 games** and transfer them as needed. 
- High-speed external NVMe SSDs, though no models are officially supported yet. Compatible drives will allow playing PS5 games directly from the external storage.
- Upgrading the internal SSD storage directly, enabled by Sony in a future firmware update later this year. This promises the best performance but drives will be very expensive. 
For now, external drives provide safe, affordable ways to gain additional terabytes of storage. But internal SSD upgrades will unlock the full potential of the PS5's high-speed architecture once available later in 2022.
## Part 6: The Future of PlayStation 5 Storage Solutions
As new NVMe SSD and storage technologies emerge, Sony will likely support faster and higher capacity drives over time. Third-party manufacturers are already working on developing compatible M.2 expansion cards that will snap directly into the PS5 later this year. And as NAND flash memory prices continue falling, multi-terabyte internal SSD upgrades should become more affordable options within the lifespan of the PS5 console generation. Sony is also certain to refine and expand their external storage support with new firmware features. The storage challenges of the PS5 are just growing pains which will ease as the platform matures over the years. Expect ever-increasing options to maximize storage capacity and take full advantage of the powerful PlayStation 5's hardware abilities both now and in the future.
In conclusion, while the PlayStation 5 launched with limited internal storage that fills up quickly, Sony has clearly recognized this as an issue and is committed to expanding options over time. Through USB hard drives, NVMe SSDs, and future internal upgrades, PS5 owners will gain increasing freedom to build out massive game libraries. Storage capacity will no longer be a restricting limitation as the platform moves forward.
