As an American planning a trip to Brunei, there are a few things you should be aware of before your visit. From restrictions on alcohol to transportation and customs, read on for everything you need to know for a smooth experience in this small Southeast Asian nation.
### **Transport and Getting Around**
One of the first things visitors notice is how spacient Brunei's roads are. **public transportation Brunei** options include inexpensive public buses for $1 between major towns, or pricier taxis which can be difficult to find outside the main cities. Consider downloading the **DART ride-hailing app Brunei** to request transfers like Uber. While roads are wide, taxis and buses run less frequently on Fridays from noon to 3pm for Muslim prayers. 
For exploring further afield, tour companies offer packaged day trips. One popular choice is a river trip through virgin rainforest to a **canopy walkway in Temburong Brunei**, offering breathtaking views of the dense treetops over a hundred feet up. Make sure to pack sensible shoes, sun protection, and don't expect air conditioning on long boat rides. Multi-hour transfers are also common to reach more remote locations.

### **Dining Options and Cuisine**  
Bruneian cuisine blends Malay, Chinese, and Western influences. **halal restaurants Bandar Seri Begawan** are abundant in cities and towns, usually open from breakfast till late evening except on prayer days. Look for nasi katok (rice with topping), ambuyat (galangal fern), and soto (soup). Western and Asian fusion options have grown recently too. Outside major areas, family-run shops and hawker stalls are the most common dining choices. 
It's advised to avoid eating or drinking in public places from 6am to 6:30pm during Ramadan out of respect. Non-halal establishments serving pork and alcohol exist but are limited to specific hotels and expatriate communities. Grocery stores are well-stocked if you prefer self-catering. Fresh market stalls at Pasar Gadong offer a culturally immersive way to shop for snacks and produce too.
### **Alcohol, Drugs, and Nightlife** 
Brunei strictly enforces **total alcohol ban**, so anything stronger than non-alcoholic beer cannot be purchased, consumed or brought into the country legally. Travelers have been known to make trips to nearby Limbang, Malaysia specifically to drink at bars and beerhouses after buying duty-free alcohol seals. **recreational drugs are also illegal** and carry severe penalties. 
Nightlife options are limited, especially in the capital of Bandar Seri Begawan. Most establishments close by 10 or 11pm. **Things to do at night Brunei** include strolling the illuminated Kampong Ayer water village or Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque, catching a late movie, or hanging out at Western-style cafes and restaurants in commercial townships like Gadong and Kiulap which have longer hours. Expat bars exist but are usually members-only.
### **Attire and Cultural Norms** 
Dress code is relatively moderate but **modest clothing Brunei** is recommended especially when visiting mosques or government buildings. Cover shoulders and knees for both men and women. Swimsuits should be covered up outside beaches. Hijabs are seldom mandatory except for certain mosques but some local women do wear them. 
Public displays of affection are frowned upon. **Shaking hands Brunei culture** is common when meeting both men and women. Remove shoes when entering private Malay homes or mosques. Photography is permitted except inside active prayer areas. Gifts of kueh lapis (colorful layered cake) make a nice gesture when visiting local families.
### **Things to See and Activities**
The beautiful Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in Bandar is a must-see, as is browsing the waterfront Kampong Ayer stilt village. Royal palaces hold special openings during Muslim festivals where locals traditionally feast for days and the Sultan may greet visitors. Nature lovers can hike through lush rainforests, spot wildlife along river trails, or relax on unspoiled beaches. 
Museums provide cultural insight into Brunei's history, architecture, and crafts. Recreational centers and theme parks cater to families on weekends. Colorful festive parades and fireworks often accompany important holidays. Golf, tennis, swimming, and guided scuba diving trips are popular too if you seek active pursuits. With so much natural beauty and heritage sites to discover, Brunei rewards slow exploration off the beaten path.
### **Travel Essentials**
- Passports with at least 6 months validity and onward/return tickets required for visa on arrival. 
- Currency is Brunei Dollar (BND) which is pegged to Singapore Dollar (SGD) for easy conversion. Credit cards widely accepted but **ATMs Brunei** provide best exchange rates. 
- Climate is hot and humid year-round with frequent rainfalls. Pack light clothing, swimwear, sun protection and plan indoor activities for midday. 
- English widely spoken but basic Malay and Mandarin phrases appreciated. Mobile data works on international roaming. 
- Medical facilities are of a high standard. No vaccinations required aside from yellow fever for travelers from affected areas. 
- **Tourist information Brunei** is available at airports, hotels or online. Major international brands found in malls nationwide.
With its unique culture, pristine natural attractions and welcoming people, Brunei offers visitors a glimpse of old-world charm amidst modern comforts. Advance planning ensures a smooth experience in this safe, easy Southeast Asian country to explore off the beaten path.
