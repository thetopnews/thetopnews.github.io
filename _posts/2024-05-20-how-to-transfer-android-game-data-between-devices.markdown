### Backing Up Game Data
There are several effective methods for transferring game data between Android devices. Whether you need to move your progress to a new phone or want to have a backup, taking the time to properly save your files ensures your hard work isn't lost. This comprehensive guide will walk through different backup and restore techniques that work with or without root access.

### Transferring Without Root Using File Managers  
One of the simplest options is to manually locate and copy the relevant game folders using a file manager app. Most games store all the important data in the **Android/data** directory under the package name folder. This contains files like save games, configs, and local scores. For some larger titles, there may also be additional data in **Android/obb** named after the package. To transfer:
Copy these folders to your PC or new device. Next, it's recommended to create an **APK backup file** as well for reinstalling the game. This retains metadata and settings. Once the folders and APK are in the proper locations on the target device, reinstall the game and connect to download any server-side data on the first launch.
### Titanium Backup for Rooted Devices
If your device is rooted, Titanium Backup is a powerful tool for completely backing up an app, including all its data and settings, to your SD card or internal storage. Start by downloading Titanium Backup from the Play Store. Then select the game you want to backup within the app. Titanium Backup will automatically place the backed up APK and data folders in its internal folder structure. 
To restore, copy the corresponding Titanium Backup folder to the new rooted device. Launch Titanium Backup and restore the game from the app list. This method retains all aspects of the original game installation for seamless transferring.
### Alternative Transfer Techniques
For non-rooted devices, there are still options beyond manual file manager copying. "Share It" allows wireless transferring between two phones over WiFi. Install it on both devices, select the game data folders, and quickly send them over. Alternatively, cloud services like Dropbox enable uploading files to the cloud from one device and downloading on another.
### Maintaining File Structure 
When transferring game data, it is crucial the folder and file hierarchy remains unchanged. Games rely on specific filenames and paths to locate save files and packs. If anything is modified during copying, it can lead to corruption or an inability to load the transferred data. Take care to select the entirety of contents within the data and obb folders rather than individual files.
### Handling Large File Sizes
Some newer or high-graphic games can have **multi-gigabyte** data packages which are difficult to transfer as a whole. In these cases, use a file manager with folder selection tools to grab subsets of folders and files for more manageable copying between devices. If the WiFi connection is reliable, opt to transfer over wireless for better speeds than a USB connection. As a last resort, compressing files into a zip then extracting on the destination device works.
### Troubleshooting Issues  
Common problems arise from changes to folder structure, deleted cache files, or incompatibilities between devices. First, fully clear cache and stored data for both the game and file manager apps used. Reinstall the game APK after the file transfer completes. Cross check that permissions and ownership data were retained properly on copied folders and files as well. Firmware or OS version mismatches can also interfere - check for compatibility details.
### Multi-Device Backup Strategy
While transferring game files between two Android phones works well, maintaining a backup off-device provides an additional layer of safety. Periodically copying saved game folders to your PC or backing up to a cloud service prevents loss from stolen or damaged phones. When transferring large games, it may be necessary to split copying across multiple file transfer sessions over time rather than attempting one huge transfer that could fail. Keep folder structures organized on backup drives for easy access later on.
### Conclusion
With the right techniques, all your progress in favorite Android games can seamlessly switch to new devices. Taking time to properly backup game data as whole folder sets avoids potential corruption issues down the line. Experiment with different apps and methods to find the most reliable solution based on your specific device setup and file sizes involved. A little preparation goes a long way towards keeping treasured saves safe no matter what changes.
