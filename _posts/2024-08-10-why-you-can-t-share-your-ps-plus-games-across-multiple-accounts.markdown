### Playstation Plus game libraries belong to individual accounts
PlayStation Plus gives users access to a growing catalog of free games each month. **However, these digital game licenses belong solely to the PlayStation Plus subscriber's individual account, not the console itself.** Each Playstation Network account needs its own active PS Plus membership in order to access and play the catalog of free games.

### Licenses cannot be transferred between user profiles
Even if multiple user profiles log into the same console system, the digital game licenses granted by PS Plus cannot be shared or transferred between accounts. **Sony considers each PSN account as a separate entity**, and requires every individual account to redeem the monthly PS Plus titles under their own profile in order to maintain access to the games once the subscription expires.
### PS Plus games are essentially rentals tied to subscriptions
While Sony promotes the PS Plus games as free without any other purchase required, users are essentially just **renting access to the titles for as long as their subscription remains active.** Letting the PS Plus membership lapse will lock the user out of all previously redeemed games until renewing the subscription on that same account. The digital licenses do not truly belong to the user.
### One email equals one unique PSN profile
PlayStation Network ties all user accounts directly to the registered email address. This ensures that **every PSN profile is distinguished by a unique identifier that cannot be duplicated or shared.** Users are unable to maintain multiple active accounts under the same email, requiring a separate email address for any additional profiles they want to create. 
### Restricting sharing increases digital content revenue
By confining PS Plus games and subscriptions to only the individual account they were redeemed on, Sony aims to prevent widespread account sharing behaviors that could negatively impact its digital revenue. If users forget to renew on an old profile, they have no choice but to repurchase those **previously downloaded PlayStation game titles** to regain access through a new account.
### Lessons from other digital platforms reinforce boundaries
Like popular PC platforms such as Steam, Sony establishes well-defined boundaries around user accounts and digital content ownership to help curb piracy and lost revenue. Games purchased or redeemed through one Steam account remain tied to just that profile indefinitely. Any additional user profiles need unique login credentials and must separately purchase **downloadable indie games** or other content to access it.
### Stick to your main account for lasting access 
Unless banned, players should consistently use the same primary PSN profile long-term in order to maintain full control and access over **all digital PlayStation game collections** purchased or redeemed over time without risk of losing content or having to repurchase elsewhere. Frequently switching between accounts could eventually sever the ties to owned content.
### PS Plus sharing blocked account-wide 
In summary, the PlayStation Plus subscription model authorizes access to the monthly free games catalog on a per-account basis only. Switching to another user profile means players must restart memberships and re-redeem past titles under the new account to access them again going forward. Sony prohibits widespread sharing of digital content between user accounts.
### Renew diligently to preserve your game library
To retain unrestricted access to the full scope of games acquired over time through PS Plus subscriptions and digital purchases, users must make reliably renewing memberships on their primary PSN profile a high priority. Letting subscriptions lapse on the main account risks permanently **losing access to a backlog of downloaded PlayStation titles** until repurchasing under a different profile.
