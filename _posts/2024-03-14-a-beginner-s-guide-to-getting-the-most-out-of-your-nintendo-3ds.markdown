### **Cleaning Your 3DS Screens**
The touch screens on the Nintendo 3DS are prone to accumulating fingerprints and grime over time. Properly maintaining your screens helps preserve their functionality and appearance. There are a few simple steps you can take to clean both the top and bottom screens. 
Use a **soft, lint-free microfiber cloth** designed specifically for cleaning delicate surfaces like touch screens. Dampen the cloth very slightly with water and gently wipe away any dirt or smears from the screen surface. Be careful not to apply too much moisture, which could potentially damage sensitive electronics. Once the screen is wiped down, dry it thoroughly with a dry portion of the cloth to prevent water spots. 
For stubborn debris stuck in hard-to-reach corners or button edges, you can use a **cotton swab or cotton ball** moistened with just a drop of water. Twist and turn the swab gently to lift debris without scratching the screen. Make sure to dry the area completely afterwards. Avoid using paper towels or tissues, as these can scratch. Similarly, do **not use household cleaners, glass cleaners, alcohol, or abrasive chemicals** which could strip protective coatings or damage layers in the screens over time. Stick to plain water and microfiber cloths made specifically for electronics.

### **Removing Dust and Lint**  
The crevices and venting around a 3DS make it prone to collecting dust and lint that can negatively impact touch responsiveness and visual clarity over time. Regular light cleaning helps keep these pollutants at bay.
A good initial technique is to use transparent **cellophane tape** to gently lift dust from edges and crevices without dirt accumulating under your fingernails. Press the sticky side of the tape against problem areas and peel away for a satisfying reveal of trapped dust and fibers. For larger surfaces like the screen, you can blow a burst of **gentle, directed compressed air** from a canister to dislodge and float dust away. 
A **new, ultra-soft toothbrush** can also help scrub stuck-on debris from hard to reach areas without damage. Dip the bristles in isopropyl alcohol and scrub gently at an edge while tilting the system to let debris escape. Use bristle tips cautiously to avoid scratches. Always dry thoroughly afterwards with a microfiber cloth to prevent moisture from creeping into ports and circuits.
### **Transferring Data to a New 3DS**
If you upgrade to a newer Nintendo 3DS model or want to move your data to a second system for portable play, the Nintendo 3DS Family offers easy built-in options. From the System Settings menu, select "Move Your Save Data" to wirelessly transmit compatible **save data, downloaded software and updates** between devices on the same Nintendo Network ID account. Physical game cards must be reinserted individually. For backup, you can also archive save data to a microSD card.
### **Playing a Wide Catalog of 3DS Games** 
One of the greatest strengths of the Nintendo 3DS is its expansive library of top-quality first and third-party titles. From big Nintendo franchises to ambitious indie games, there are **hundreds of excellent options** that take advantage of the system's unique dual-screen gameplay. Games are accessed either physically via GAME CARTRIDGES that slot neatly into the slot on the bottom of the device, or digitally by purchasing titles from the Nintendo eShop using a WiFi connection.
Titles like Super Mario 3D Land, Animal Crossing: New Leaf and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds are must-plays that exemplify the platformâ€™s innovative touch-and-tilt gameplay. Retro collections like Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console bring beloved older games like The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening to the portable screen with upgraded features. Indie darlings like Shovel Knight also bring new life and variety. And ambitious third-party RPGs and action games further expand the diversity of genres represented.
### **Compatible Accessories for Custom Gaming**
While the stock 3DS hardware offers great flexibility right out of the box, various compatible add-ons let you further customize your experience. The Circle Pad Pro accessory attaches cleanly to the bottom of the system to provide an extra control stick for full dual-analog control in 3D games that support it, like Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Styluses are included but specialized larger grips or shorter, thicker third-party styluses may improve your precision for certain art and design applications. Travel cases and stands provide protection on the go while allowing hands-free viewing. And extra portable battery packs can help stave off low battery warnings when playing for extended periods away from an outlet.
