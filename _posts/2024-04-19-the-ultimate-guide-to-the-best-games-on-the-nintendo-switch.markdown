### **Platformers and Adventure Games**  
The Nintendo Switch is home to some of the best platforming and adventure games available. **Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,** and **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** truly showcase what the system is capable of with their polished gameplay and visuals. Mario Odyssey in particular utilizes the Switch's portability perfectly, allowing players to explore colorful kingdoms and take possession of enemies and objects with Mario's new capture ability anywhere they go. Breath of the Wild redefined the open-world genre and paved the way for other masterful entries like **Pokemon Legends Arceus** with its emphasis on player freedom. **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** and **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** are beloved multiplayer experiences that are always a hit at parties whether playing together on the TV or separately in handheld mode.

### **Online Shooters and Battles**
Several excellent online shooters are also available on Switch. **Splatoon 2** stands out for its family friendly yet competitive third-person shooter gameplay revolving around covering maps in colorful ink. **Overwatch** and **Doom** deliver fast-paced multiplayer mayhem in colorful worlds despite some downgrades from their console and PC counterparts. Even games with limited Switch cross-play like **Fortnite** are hugely popular on Nintendo's platform thanks to its mobile appeal and charming art style, though players cannot easily squad up with friends on other consoles. 
### **Couch Co-op Party Games** 
The Switch is perfect for local multiplayer fun anywhere in the home or on the go. Colorful and frantic cooking games like **Overcooked** and **Overcooked 2** are instant classics for teamwork and laughter whether alone or with others. **Snipperclips** utilizes creative puzzles that require careful cooperation. **Mario Party Superstars** refines the classic party game formula into a more competitive yet still accessible package suitable for both children and adults. **Unravel Two** tells a touching co-op story for two players. And **Towerfall Ascension** provides intense but pick-up-and-play friendly competitive archery battles.
### **Memorable 2D Platformers**
In addition to bundled retro games through Nintendo Switch Online, acclaimed indie 2D platformers populate the eShop. Standouts include **Celeste**'s challenging but fair gameplay about a girl and her struggles with anxiety, **Hollow Knight**'s massive hand-drawn world to explore, and **Dead Cells**' roguelike take on the metroidvania formula. **Cuphead**'s gorgeous 1930s cartoon visuals and music come to life in frantic boss rush stages. **Ori and the Will of the Wisps** expands on its already beloved prequel's emotional story and Metroidvania elements. And **Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze** is a must-play with its polished retro aesthetic and challenging Kong-focused levels.
### **Beloved Ported Classics**  
Thanks to the Switch's portable gaming ability, acclaimed games from other systems both old and new have found new life. The epic open-world of **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** is fully playable during commutes or vacations. **Dark Souls** remains as punishingly fun as ever in its definitive remastered state. Wholesome farming and life simulator **Stardew Valley** is an endless feel-good timesink. And games like **Undertale, Minecraft,** and **Katamari Damacy REROLL** attract both existing fans and new players with their creative premises. Having these extensive award-winning titles on the go expands the Switch's already extensive library immensely.
### **Timeless Nintendo Exclusives**
Nintendo continues pushing innovative ideas with exclusive franchises that can only be experienced on Switch. The legendary open-air adventure **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** redefined that series and garnered widespread acclaim. The latest generation of **Pokemon** games, including **Pokemon Legends: Arceus,** blend exploration and battles in immersive living worlds. Meanwhile, **Animal Crossing: New Horizons** appealed to people of all types during worldwide lockdowns. And **Luigi's Mansion 3** cleverly builds upon the spooky ghost-catching premise with multiplayer Co-op abilities. These experiences epitomize the fun, creativity, and heart customers expect from Nintendo.
### **Unique Indie Gems and Surprises**  
The Switch eShop constantly delivers surprises outside anticipated franchises. **Cadence of Hyrule** combined the musical rhythmic gameplay of Crypt of the NecroDancer with a fresh Zelda story. **Untitled Goose Game** charmed all ages with its mischievous feathered protagonist. Roguelike action games like **Hades** and **Dead Cells** featured exciting hack-and-slash combat. And hybrids such as **Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle** and **Golf Story** blended unlikely genres to great success. Even niches are covered, from relaxed farming RPG **Rune Factory 5** to charming underwater adventure **Splashlings**. With its affordability and strong indie support, the Switch consistently offers unexpected discoveries.
### **Exciting Projects on the Horizon**
With Nintendo and partners constantly expanding the library, the future looks bright. Highly anticipated sequels in the works include **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, Metroid Prime 4,** and **Bayonetta 3** for their influential franchises. Meanwhile, original projects like **Pokemon Scarlet and Violet** point to new regions to explore. And Nintendo shows no signs of slowing support with the promise of more indie games, quirky hybrids, Shin Megami Tensei installments, and partnerships with studios like Platinum Games. With such an already impressive selection and constant new software on the way, the Switch is primed to remain the preeminent console for both dedicated gamers and newcomers for years to come thanks to its genre-blending design.
