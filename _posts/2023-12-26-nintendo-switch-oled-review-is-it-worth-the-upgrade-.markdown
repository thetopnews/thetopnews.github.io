## A Subtle But Impactful Upgrade
### **Nintendo Switch OLED screen brings richer visuals with vivid colors and deep blacks**
The Nintendo Switch OLED model was recently released with some subtle but impactful upgrades over the original Switch. Having owned my original Switch since 2017, I was interested to see if the upgrades of the OLED model, particularly the new screen, would be noticeable enough to justify an upgrade. 
After seeing a friend's new Switch OLED, I was impressed by the vibrant colors and true blacks provided by the OLED panel. While the differences may not seem huge on paper, experiencing games like Breath of the Wild side by side really highlighted the richness of the OLED screen. Text and menus popped more with improved contrast, and colors looked bolder and more lifelike. The larger 7-inch screen also made handheld gaming feel more immersive.
Overall, the visual upgrades are a clear step up from the original Switch for handheld gameplay. While the differences won't be groundbreaking for everyone, gamers who value better screen quality and vibrant visuals will especially appreciate the OLED model.

## Better Docked Experience and Minor Feature Upgrades
### **Ethernet port and improved audio enhancements convenience when docked** 
In addition to the superior screen, the OLED Switch brings some quality of life improvements for both handheld and docked play. One handy upgrade is the addition of an Ethernet port directly on the dock, removing the need for an external adapter. This makes wired internet connectivity more seamless when docked. 
The improved speakers on the OLED model also provide noticeably better audio quality compared to the original Switch when playing in handheld mode. Games and menus sound richer and more balanced versus the somewhat tinny audio of the original.
Battery life sees a slight bump according to Nintendo, lasting approximately 9 hours versus the original Switch's 6-8 hours. While just an hour or two extra, this modest boost is appreciated for longer gaming sessions away from an outlet.
Overall, these additions, though minor, enhance the overall experience whether playing handheld or docked. The Ethernet port in particular streamlines online play when docked at home. Combined with the superior display, the OLED model offers a refined Switch package.
## Identical Gaming Performance and Controller Concerns Remain 
### **Processing power, performance, and joy-con connectivity are unchanged from original Switch**
While the display and some new features shine on the OLED Switch, under the hood the new model is identical to the original and Switch V2 in terms of core specs and functionality. This means that gaming performance remains consistent across all Switch consoles - games load and play at the same speeds and resolutions regardless of the model. 
On the downside, technical issues that have plagued past Switch models, like the infamous Joy-Con drift problem, are also present in the OLED's Joy-Cons. The unimproved controllers and identical internal hardware mean that drifting Joy-Cons can still become a frustration over time for OLED owners. Additionally, concerns around Joy-Con connectivity are unchanged between models.
So for those hoping the OLED would bring meaningful upgrades to processing power or resolve longstanding issues, the new features ultimately don't impact the core gaming experience or performance in any significant way. But those tradeoffs were likely intentional given Nintendo's focus on refining the experience in other areas like the screen and convenience additions.
## Existing Owners: Minor Upgrades Don't Justify Cost
### **Screen and feature improvements on OLED are too incremental to warrant an expensive upgrade for current Switch owners** 
As an owner of the original Nintendo Switch since launch in 2017, I don't feel the upgrades of the OLED model are substantial enough to justify replacing my current system, at least at the $350 price point. While it's great to see continued evolution of the Switch hardware, the changes are quite incremental for existing owners. 
Yes, the improved screen quality and minor convenience additions are noticeable upgrades. However, those coming from any existing Switch model will find most facets of the gaming experience remain almost identical between hardware revisions. The refined OLED experience alone does not provide enough of a leap forward to warrant dropping hundreds of dollars to upgrade from a fully-functioning Switch.
Unless the screen quality differences are completely transformative to one's enjoyment, or extra features like the Ethernet port are truly must-haves, current Switch owners are better saving their money and sticking with their reliable systems that still deliver amazing games. Upgrading solely for iterative hardware changes would not provide strong value for money in my view.
## New Buyers: OLED Model Is the One to Get
### **Larger OLED screen, refined features make Switch OLED the best option for new Nintendo fans** 
For those in the market for their very first Nintendo Switch console, the Switch OLED Model should absolutely be the version to purchase in 2021 and beyond. Despite the incremental upgrades, the overall experience the OLED provides out of the box makes it the clear choice for new adopters looking to jump into this stellar library of games. 
Getting that beautiful OLED screen, little extras like the improved speakers and Ethernet port, and that larger form factor right from the start helps maximize enjoyment of this stellar hybrid platform. While slightly higher in price than a regular Switch, the overall refined package and premium look and feel of the OLED make it absolutely worth paying a bit extra as a new owner.
Essentially, veterans can stick with their reliable original units, but anyone new to Switch world simply cannot go wrong starting with top of the line hardware and features on the OLED model. Its presentation and subtle user experience enhancements cement it as the best option for first-time Switch buyers seeking a premium gaming experience right out of the box.
## Conclusion: A Refined Experience Worth Considering
### **OLED Switch offers worthwhile upgrades, especially for new buyers, but regular Switch remains a quality budget option** 
In conclusion, while I don't feel compelled to upgrade my existing Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED model does offer worthwhile refinements that enhance both handheld and docked gameplay. The vibrant OLED screen alone helps justify its prices tag for those looking for premium visuals and newer adopters. Additionally, the OLED system represents the definitive Switch experience right out of the retail box.
However, for budget-conscious current owners or families with multiple Switches, the standard Nintendo Switch remains an amazing option that continues delivering great Nintendo games both at home and on the go. It hits an outstanding value point even years after launch.
So in summary - the OLED presents incremental but impactful upgrades that make it worth considering, especially for new Switch shoppers. Existing owners need not feel compelled to double dip unless screen quality is a top priority. Overall, both models ensure Nintendo fans can continue enjoying their hybrid gaming experiences for many years to come.
