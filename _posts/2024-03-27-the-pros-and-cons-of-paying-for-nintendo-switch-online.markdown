## Introduction
Nintendo Switch now requires a paid online membership for online multiplayer and other online features. With Nintendo Switch Online, gamers get access to online multiplayer in some of the most popular Switch games like **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**, **Splatoon 2**, and **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate**. Subscribers also get access to a growing library of classic games from the **Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)** and **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)** consoles. In addition, the subscription offers benefits like cloud saves and exclusive deals. However, there are also some drawbacks to consider with Nintendo Switch Online requiring ongoing subscription fees and relying on an internet connection.
### A New Era of Paid Online Gaming on Switch
For many years, Nintendo allowed online multiplayer on its consoles without any subscription fees. However, market pressures and the success of Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus incentivized Nintendo to follow suit and implement a paid online service for the Switch. With Nintendo Switch Online, the company aims to compete directly with other consoles while also differentiating through its library of retro games.

## Benefits of Nintendo Switch Online
### Enjoying Online Multiplayer Games with Friends 
Some of the most popular Switch titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate truly shine when playing against other players online. Nintendo Switch Online is necessary to access these robust online communities and matchmaking features. The paid subscription expands the possible player pool and ensures continued server support.
### Nostalgia and New Experiences with Classic NES and SNES Games
In addition to supporting online play, Nintendo Switch Online gives subscribers access to play classic retro titles from the NES and SNES era. This growing library offers a fun dose of nostalgia as well as a chance to discover new older games. Popular 8- and 16-bit titles like Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and StarFox 2 provide countless hours of additional gaming content through the subscription.
### Ensuring Saved Game Data with Cloud Saves 
One of the most valuable benefits of Nintendo Switch Online is cloud saves. This feature automatically uploads save data to Nintendo's servers so it isn't lost if something happens to the user's Switch console or SD card. Cloud saves give players peace of mind knowing their progress in games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be safe.
### Exclusive Deals and Discounts
Subscribers also gain access to occasional exclusive deals or discounts in the Nintendo eShop. These offers provide extra value for the membership costs by saving players money on software, add-ons, and other purchases over time.
## Drawbacks of the Paid Subscription  
### Ongoing Subscription Fees
Unlike the previous era of free online play, Nintendo Switch Online requires either monthly or annual subscription payments to access standard online features. These recurring fees can amount to $20-60 per year depending on the membership tier chosen. For some, these costs cut into the overall affordability of Nintendo's ecosystem over multiple years of ownership.
### Limited Selection of Retro Games
While the library of classic NES and SNES titles continues expanding each month, it remains much smaller than the collections available on past virtual console services for Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. Popular requested titles are still missing. This limited selection means there is less overall value from the retro games than some players desire from a paid subscription.
### Reliance on Internet Connectivity
Nintendo Switch Online functionality depends entirely on an internet connection. This means that anywhere a stable WiFi or mobile data connection cannot be maintained, core Switch features are inaccessible until connectivity returns. A spotty connection during online multiplayer can also negatively impact the gameplay experience versus dedicated servers.
### Potential for Less Stable Connections  
Without dedicated servers, matchmaking and online games on Switch are hosted via peer-to-peer connections between systems. This architecture can lead to decreased stability compared to dedicated servers, opening the door for increased lag, dropped matches, and cheating risks marring the experience.
## Comparisons to Other Platforms
### Industry Standard But Late Adoption by Nintendo
Microsoft and Sony helped establish paid online gaming subscriptions as the standard approach across consoles over a decade ago with Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus. By maintaining free online multiplayer on Wii and Wii U for so long, Nintendo was resisting the industry trend. In coming to Switch, they finally joined their competitors in the subscription model.
### PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Feature Parity
While aiming for its own stylized approach and differentiating factors like classic games, the core online features provided by Nintendo Switch Online are comparable but less robust than PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold. Competitors offer dedicated servers for games, larger online communities, and more functionality through their apps and multimedia options.
### Differentiating with Retro Catalog Instead of Servers 
Rather than trying to match rival networks server for server, Nintendo leverage's the company's classic game IP to set Switch Online apart. Giving players access to legendary 8-bit and 16-bit titles is a nostalgic perk not provided elsewhere that helps justify the subscription costs for Nintendo fans.
## Player Reactions
### Frustration over Loss of "Free" Online Access
Many longtime Nintendo owners who enjoyed free online play on systems like the Wii and 3DS have expressed frustration over the Switch shifting to a paid model years later. Having to start paying what used to be a free service rankles some consumers used to cost-free online.
### Complacent Acceptance by Many Players 
Alternatively, a portion of the Switch player base has somewhat complacently accepted Nintendo's move to subscriptions as an inevitable industry direction mirroring competitors. As long as the core online experience remains usable, these subscribers are satisfied.  
### Perceived as an Unnecessary Money Grab
More critical opinions argue that beyond basic server costs to support matchmaking, Nintendo Switch Online provides negligible quality enhancements to warrant ongoing subscription payments. From this view, it appears primarily motivated as a profitable revenue stream exploiting dedicated Nintendo fans.
## Conclusion 
With Nintendo Switch Online, the debate continues around whether paid online gaming provides tangible value relative to its costs charged to players. Both perspectives have valid points - while conveniences like cloud saves and classic games are gained, core online functionality also transitioned to a paid model where it was once free. In the end, individual subscribers will need to decide if Nintendo Switch Online delivers enough benefits to justify recurring subscription expenditures based on their own usage patterns and priorities. Both pros and cons exist to the service, and reasonable arguments remain on both sides of this ongoing discussion.
