The Microsoft Visual C++ development environment is a powerful tool that millions of programmers rely on to build Windows applications. Whether you are new to C++ or a seasoned veteran, it's important to know the exact version of Visual C++ that is installed on your development machine. Your Visual C++ version determines things like which language features and compilers are available, as well as compatibility with third-party libraries and frameworks. This detailed guide will walk through several different methods you can use to check your Visual C++ version on Windows 10.
#### Check Installed Updates in the Windows Control Panel
The Windows Control Panel provides an easy way to view installed software and updates on your system. To find your Visual C++ version here:
1. Open the Start menu and type "control panel", then select the result 
2. In the Control Panel window, click on "Programs" in the navigation pane on the left
3. Select "Programs and Features" 
4. In the programs list, look for "Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable (x64)" or a similar entry
5. Double-click the Visual C++ redistributable to view its properties 
6. Switch to the "Version" tab to see the installed version number, such as 14.16.27023 for Visual C++ 2017
Checking the Control Panel is a **convenient method** for anyone who wants to quickly verify their Visual C++ version without using the command line.

#### Browse Installed Programs with Add/Remove Programs
If you need a visual list of all programs currently installed on your PC, the Add/Remove Programs tool provides easy access. Here are the steps: 
1. Open the Start menu and type "uninstall a program", then select the top result
2. The Add/Remove Programs window lists every application on your system
3. Scroll through the long list to find "Microsoft Visual C++" 
4. The version number will be displayed in the last column
This method works well for users who want to see Visual C++ listed alongside other installed software on their system. It provides a full overview of what's installed without jumping between different tools.
#### Check Version from the Developer Command Prompt
For developers comfortable with the command line, using the developer command prompt provides direct access to core C++ tools. Here are the quick steps:
1. Open the Start menu and search for "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" or similar based on your Visual Studio version  
2. The command prompt window that opens uses the Visual Studio/Visual C++ environment variables
3. Simply type "cl" and press enter to launch the Visual C++ compiler
4. The compiler banner displays the Visual C++ version, such as "Version 19.29.30137"
This **direct compiler method** is ideal for developers who regularly use the command line and need to validate the Visual C++ tools are available. It provides a fast, simple check at the UNIX-style shell.
#### Check the Default C++ Standard Setting
In addition to the installed version, you may also want to verify the default C++ standard level supported by your Visual C++ compiler. Here is one way to do that:
1. Create a file named `check_standard.cpp` 
2. Add the code:
```cpp 
#include <iostream>
int main() {
std::cout << __cplusplus;
return 0;
}
```
3. Open a developer command prompt and navigate to the folder 
4. Execute: `cl /EHsc /Zc:__cplusplus check_standard.cpp`
5. The compiler will print out the defined __cplusplus macro, such as 199711L for C++11
This allows you to determine the baseline C++ standard your projects will use, such as C++11, C++14 or later. It's important information for choosing language features and library dependencies.
#### Discover the Latest Supported C++ Standard
Going a step further, you can find out the maximum C++ standard version supported by your compiler:
1. In the same project folder, create a new file called `latest_standard.cpp`  
2. Add this line: `std::cout << "Hello World\n";`  
3. Run: `cl /EHsc /Zc:__cplusplus /std:c++latest latest_standard.cpp`
4. The compiler will attempt to use the newest standard and print its version
5. For Visual Studio 2022 this would be `c++20` or possibly a newer preview standard
Knowing the ceiling for C++ standards allows you to leverage cutting-edge features while ensuring compatibility with your toolchain. It's useful for testing new language features before proposing major codebase upgrades.
#### Visual C++ Version Checks for Older Systems
The techniques above focused on current versions of Visual C++ for Windows 10. But older development environments have different ways to identify the installed version:
- On Windows Vista/7/8, look in Control Panel or Add/Remove programs  
- Compiling code that prints `__cplusplus` will still work, showing version like 199711L
- older debug builds printed version strings, e.g. "Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 16.00.30319.01 for 80x86"
Maintaining legacy C++ code or cross-compiling for older Windows versions requires understanding older Visual C++ behaviors and version identification methods.
In summary, this article covered several powerful techniques for **programmers to check the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler version** installed on their Windows 10 system. Knowing your exact version ensures code compatibility and helps determine when an upgrade may be needed. The methods shown here work for all skill levels, from beginners to experts, and provide good starting points for any C++ development environment checks.
