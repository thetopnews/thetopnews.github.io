### Trying Games You Were Considering Purchasing
Game Pass provides tremendous value by allowing subscribers to try out games they were thinking about buying before committing to a purchase. With over 100 titles available as part of the membership, there is a good chance that any game you have had your eye on is included in the library. 
For example, when **Gears 5** was first released in 2019, I was interested in the single player campaign but unsure if I wanted to spend $60 on it. Thanks to Game Pass, I was able to play through the entire story and get fully immersed in the **Gears of War** universe without spending a dime up front. After completing the game, I came to really appreciate the developer The Coalition's attention to detail and storytelling. As a result, I have been more inclined to check out their other projects in the future. 
**Operencia: The Stolen Sun** is another title I may have overlooked due to its more niche genre of isometric RPGs. However, being available on Game Pass opened me up to trying something new. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the game's strategic combat and immersive fantasy world. While I likely would not have bought it at full price, Operencia's quality has made me a bit more willing to take chances on similar hidden gem style games in the future.

### Experiencing Stories Without Needing to Replay or Collect
While Game Pass allows playing many games for free, the subscription is not indefinite. For games with rich narratives that you have no intention or need to replay, the service provides a great way to experience the story without needing to maintain ownership long term. 
The **Yakuza series** is a prime example. Each numbered entry has over 20+ hours of cinematic cutscenes, side missions and minigames to engross yourself in. However, once I have completed the main storyline, I typically feel satisfied and have no strong desire to immediately replay these games. With Game Pass, I was able to work through **Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2** back-to-back, immersing myself in the world of the Japanese crime syndicates without taking up lasting space on my HDD or feeling compelled to keep and replay physical discs. The stories and characters were simply an enjoyable ride while they were freely available that I can now appreciate from memory.
### Treating it like Old School Game Demo Discs		
Even after letting a Game Pass subscription lapse, the value remains thanks to how it can essentially act as an enormous library of game demos. In the days before digital storefronts, game magazines and console bundles would include demo discs packed with short trial versions of upcoming titles. 
In a similar fashion, those no longer paying a membership fee can take advantage of Game Pass' games by briefly trying dozens of them without the need for installation. Hopping between different genres, styles and developers quickly gives a taste of what each has to offer. This allows identifying hidden gems worth investing in down the line as well as ruling out those that do not suit one's preferences. 
For example, in my limited time with the service upon its Xbox One launch, I was able to sample over 15 different indie games. This exposure led me to purchase titles like **Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden** and **Sundered** months later when they went on sale, confident that I would enjoy these unique experiences based on their trials.
### Expanding Options for On-the-Go Game Sampling with Cloud Gaming
Game Pass Ultimate subscribers gain access to cloud gaming, which is currently available on Android devices and allows playing supported titles directly from the cloud. This provides a valuable perk even after discontinuing a paid membership. 
Being able to fire up games like **Gears 5** or **Forza Horizon 4** through the cloud on a mobile device expands the opportunities to check out Game Pass offerings anywhere, regardless of what is downloaded to local hardware. Some games simply work better for quick pick-up-and-play sessions versus long gaming sessions at home. 
For those with a compatible device during their commutes, lunch breaks or other downtime away from home consoles, the cloud gaming feature multiplies the potential value received from an expired Game Pass subscription. It continues fueling discovery of new genres, developers and franchises that can lead to purchases later when sales arise.
### Hunting for Discounted Favorites After Pausing Payments
One final advantage of using Game Pass, even after unsubscribing, comes from its rotation of titles exiting the catalog over time. Any games that were enjoyed thoroughly on the service but are planned for imminent removal have the opportunity to be purchased at a discounted price while still available. 
For me, when **Celeste** was announced to leave soon, I knew from my time with the acclaimed platformer on Game Pass that it deserved space in my permanent library. Snapping it up for half price right before it left the service was an easy call and I've enjoyed revisiting the game many times since at that lower entry cost. 
A similar situation occurred for me with **Hollow Knight**. Being able to secure the exceptional **metroidvania** for just $10 instead of the usual $15 asking price made optimum use of my prior access through an active Game Pass membership, ensuring I still got value long after my subscription lapsed.
### Conclusion
Even when no longer paying monthly for access, Xbox Game Pass leaves subscribers with plenty of worthwhile value received for the time invested. It acts nearly as a gargantuan free trial program for discovering new favorites across dozens of genres. Game Pass' library gives opportunities to try anticipated games, immerse in involving stories, sample hidden gems and hunt for discounts on all-time hits. 
While the constant flow of freshly added games slows to a trickle without an active subscription, those past experiences continue fueling game purchases and supporting developers for years to come. So in summary - yes, Xbox Game Pass retains significance and pays dividends on prior investment long after memberships have ended. It gives genuine bang for one's buck both during active use and in the catalogs of games that customers build over time thanks to its influence.
