For over a year now, I've spent countless hours immersed in the armored combat simulation of War Thunder. As both an avid historian and longtime player, I've enjoyed the incredible attention to detail in recreating historic tanks, planes, and boats. However, alongside the aspects I still appreciate, persistent issues have gradually led me to reconsider continuing to play. In this reflection, I delve into my thoughts on the progression systems, matchmaking experience, vehicle balancing concerns, focus on monetization over realism and fun, as well as the highly competitive community culture.  
## The Protracted and Punishing Grind to Higher Tiers
Reaching the highest tiers of armored vehicles like top-tier tanks and helicopters requires an immense grind that has only increased over time. Vehicles at those tiers demand exponentially greater research and purchase costs compared to lower tiers, with some top vehicles taking dozens or even over a hundred battles to unlock. For the average player without premium time or accounts, truly meaningful progression feels nearly impossible. This punishingly slow design appears intended more to frustrate players into spending real money than providing a rewarding long-term challenge. While some challenge to advancement makes sense, the current model often feels less like fun gameplay and more like a job.
### The Impact of Prolonged, Burdensome Vehicle Research 
The excruciatingly sluggish pace of research for new high-tier vehicles fails to respect players' time. Players want to feel accomplished through gameplay, not discouraged into paying to skip unnecessary frustrations. However, the huge resource costs for cutting-edge vehicles like **main battle tanks (MBTs)** and ultra-modern jets leave many players hitting a frustrating paywall. For a free-to-play game, this models prioritizes monetization over fostering long-term player enjoyment and retention.

## New Players Face Uphill Battles Against Experienced Opponents
Matchmaking frequently pits novice players against highly skilled veterans with thousands of hours and fully upgraded top vehicles. While skill matters, newbies joining the game stand little chance against these veteran "seal clubbers." This harms the new player experience and discourages continued play. Skill-based matchmaking would help create fairer battles by evaluating player proficiency instead of just vehicle tiers. Meanwhile, practice modes using AI bots could allow learning maps and vehicles without constant high-tier punishment for mistakes in PvP battles.   
### The Lopsided Challenge of Novice Versus Master
Starting out in War Thunder armed only with basic low-tier tanks is a daunting task when routinely facing off against opponents with years of experience. This skewed matching makes learning difficult and losing feel hopeless. Providing protected environments for new players to ease into multiplayer would foster long-term interest instead of frustration. The current matchmaking prioritizes quick queues over balanced learning opportunities.
## Issues of Vehicle Imbalance at Certain Tiers
Certain high-tier vehicles like light tanks and tank destroyers clearly outclass all others due to oversights in game mechanics. Additionally, some tanks are placed in tiers rendering them unable to compete, undermining any sense of realism or balanced gameplay. While changes do occur to address this, the constant meta shifts leave winning feeling dependent on the specific vehicles brought into battle rather than skill.
### Problems Stemming from the R3 T20 "FAI" and Similar Outliers   
One outlier that exemplifies imbalance is the high-tier Italian R3 T20 "FAI" with its rocket boosters and small profile. Its lightning speed and hard-to-hit size allow dominating matches with little effort. While a rare exception, its broken mechanics highlight problems from other undertiered and overperforming designs. Addressing outliers should take priority over constant minor rebalances spreading frustration across many vehicles.
## Mechanics Favoring Grind Over Authentic Tank Combat
War Thunder upholds its reputation for intricate vehicle modeling but falls short of realistic combat gameplay. Mechanics like volumetric shells fail to recognize real armor weak points. Additionally, arbitrary vehicle tiering prevents realistic historical matchups and denies strategic consideration of different tank roles on a team. A renewed focus on simulation over grind could restore lost authenticity and fun.
### Issues Like the Strv 103's Inaccurate Gun Depression
Small oversights severely undermine vehicles like the Swedish Strv 103, which could leverage hull-down defenses but sees its historical main gun depression rendered nonfunctional. While a niche concern, such unfinished details reflect a lack of quality assurance hurting authenticity. Immersive realism should take priority over half-baked mechanics left broken to push grind-heavy monetization.  
## A Highly Competitive Community That Can Turn Toxic
A passionate competitive culture exists among veteran War Thunder players, but this often gives way to toxicity. Losing battles frequently ignites angry outbursts in chat toward teammates perceived as underperforming. Meanwhile, cooperative "for fun" attitudes are rare compared to the dominant metagaming mindset. This type of atmosphere alienates more casual players seeking to enjoy historic vehicles without harassment.
### Hostility Stems from Overly Tryhard Mentalities  
When gameplay feels like more of a job than fun due to endless grinds, it's understandable some blow off steam through hostility. However, this also poisons the experience for others and goes against the intended spirit of a vehicle combat simulation. A shift toward relaxed cooperation over cutthroat competitiveness could heal divisions in the community.
## Server Infrastructure Fails Under High Load
Beyond issues intrinsic to the game's design, lag, rubberbanding, and unstable ping often undermine control and damage models through no fault of players. Dying due to server instability instead of outmatched skills damages the perception of fair multiplayer. While typical of many online titles, the sensitive nature of armored combat amplifies these technical problems. 
### The Unfairness of Server-Side Failures
Nothing feels quite as unjust as laggy hits registering late or tank treads locking in place due to server problems rather than outmaneuvering opponents. These unstable netcodes undermine the whole appeal of realistic vehicle interactions. Game developers must prioritize expanding server capabilities to match the playerbase.
## In Conclusion - Salvaging a Game with Lost Potential
War Thunder's attention to replicated historical vehicles retains appeal, yet issues have worn down goodwill. Gaijin's monetization-driven changes over prioritizing quality undermine the experience. While some fun remains, the same repetitious grinds and frustrations plague away enjoyment for all but the most dedicated. The talented developers clearly care about their creation, but it needs major reforms to serve broad audiences through balanced, fair and realistic gameplay once more. With adjustments to progression speeds, matchmaking, vehicle balancing and infrastructure - this game could regain its potential. For now, many long-time players feel their enthusiasm has hit its limits. With openness to feedback, War Thunder just may salvage its future.
