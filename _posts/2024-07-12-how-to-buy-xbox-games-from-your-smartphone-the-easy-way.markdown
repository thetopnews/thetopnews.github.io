### Linking Your Microsoft Account  
With the app open, sign in using the same email and password you use to access your Xbox console. Signing in in this manner ties your gaming purchases and activity across devices. **The app will automatically recognize the email and pull up your profile details** for a seamless sign-in experience. Make sure to have your account passwords handy for a quick link between phone and console.
### Selecting Your Xbox Console
After signing in, you'll be prompted to choose which Xbox system to manage. Select the **Xbox Series S** console that you own from the list of linked devices. This ensures any **digital games or add-ons purchased on your phone are downloaded directly to the correct system**. Avoid potential confusion down the line by picking the right console upfront.
### Browsing an Abundance of Game Options
With your console selected, the Xbox digital storefront opens up for exploration directly from your phone. Browse titles across various genres like action, adventure, racing and more. Get a feel for gameplay through **detailed game pages including screenshots, trailers and descriptions**. Find that next favorite to add to your cart. 
### Making Game Purchases with Ease
When you've settled on a game, simply tap the "Add to Cart" button. Continue adding multiple selections if desired. Then head to checkout where payment methods on file like credit cards can be quickly selected. In just a few taps, your new games will be purchased and ready for auto-download back on the console.
### Downloads Happen Automatically  
One of the best perks of buying digitally through the Xbox app is how effortless the download process is afterwards. Once a purchase is made, the game will automatically begin downloading to the designated console in the background. No extra steps means instant gaming satisfaction awaits back on the big screen.
### Expanding Your Library with Accessories and Subscriptions
While the app focuses mainly on digital game sales, you also have options to purchase physical games, controllers and more accessories for delivery. Simply make sure to fill out your address profile first. A great alternative is subscribing to **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for access to over 100 titles** that can be streamed or downloaded through the handy smartphone app. 
### Getting Help When Needed
Occasionally issues may arise needing support. Microsoft ensures quick resolutions through various contact methods accessible right within the app. Live chat, phone assistance and an online help center are on standby to sort out sign-in problems, payment errors or other technical bugs preventing app usage or purchases.
Overall, the redesigned Xbox app makes purchasing new content for your console remarkably simple directly from any Android phone or tablet. Familiarize yourself with the interface for a seamless process that puts the Xbox gaming library right at your fingertips.
