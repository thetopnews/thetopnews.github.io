## Part 1: Game Boy Advance Support on Original DS Models
### Game Boy Advance Games Were Fully Supported
The original Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite handheld systems were fully backwards compatible with **Game Boy Advance cartridges**, allowing users to play the entire GBA game library directly on the newer systems. This provided access to hundreds of GBA titles, as well as **Game Boy and Game Boy Color games** that were re-released on the GBA with enhanced features.

### Large GBA Library Was Available 
With a dedicated slot for GBA game cartridges, DS owners could enjoy classics like Golden Sun, Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. It also gave newer audiences a chance to play breakthrough titles that helped define the **32-bit handheld generation**. Backwards compatibility was a major advantage that helped the early DS find an engaged install base.
## Part 2: No Native Support for Original Game Boy or Game Boy Color
### Original Game Boy and GBC Needed Their Own Systems
While GBA games were fully forwards compatible, the original Nintendo DS lacked the ability to play games specifically released for the 8-bit **Game Boy and Game Boy Color consoles**. These require either the original bulky Game Boy hardware or the superior Game Boy Color to run properly due to technical limitations.
### GBC Had Enhanced Graphics and Sound Over GB  
Game Boy Color titles took advantage of the system's color screen and improved **16-bit sound chip** compared to the monochrome GB. Their graphical enhancements and additional features would not function correctly without the dedicated **Game Boy Color system architecture**.
## Part 3: Game Boy Advance Cartridge Adapter Offered a Solution
### Special Adapter Allowed Some GB/GBC Games to Run 
A little-known adapter called the **Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable** could be used to play select original Game Boy and GBC games on a DS. It worked by inserting a GB or GBC game cartridge while the adapter was plugged into the GBA slot.
### Not a Perfect Solution With Tradeoffs
However, not every older game was compatible with this setup. **Screen scaling issues** could crop up from mapping an 8-bit visual to the 16:9 widescreen. Other features like link cables and tilt-sensors were also non-functional without native hardware support.
## Part 4: Later DS Models Dropped GBA Compatibility  
### DSi Was Incompatible with GBA Games
Starting with the DSi in 2009, Nintendo removed the GBA game slot found on the earlier DS and DS Lite handhelds. This meant the **DSi and subsequent 3DS family** were not able to play Game Boy Advance titles at all without additional adapters.
### Older Gamers Relied on Game Boy Advance Support
The loss of backwards compatibility disappointed long-time Nintendo fans who enjoyed continuing their GBA libraries on newer DS hardware. For older audiences, it pushed them back to dedicated GBA systems if they wanted access to the entire Game Boy catalog.
## Part 5: Alternative Ways to Play on TV and Emulators
### Super Game Boy on SNES Provided an Early Solution  
In the early 1990s, the **Super Game Boy adapter** for the SNES Super Nintendo Entertainment System brought Game Boy games to the TV. It supported color palettes and fun borders, fulfilling an early dream of playing portable games on the big screen.
### Nintendo GameCube's Game Boy Player Was the Pinnacle
Nintendo later delivered an even better experience with the Game Boy Player, a disc-drive peripheral for the GameCube. It upscaled original Game Boy and GBC visuals beautifully on an HDTV while supporting all features and compatibilities. For many, it was the best way to experience classics.
### Emulators on PC and Mobile Opened New Avenues
With the homebrew community, emulation became a popular way for retro fans to legally play older games on more powerful hardware. Projects like **Visual Boy Advance** on PC and **My OldBoy!** on Android enabled playing the entire Game Boy library with enhancements on a big screen with ease.
## Part 6: Caveats and Exceptions to Backwards Compatibility
### A Few GBA Games Required Additional Features
In rare cases, some Game Boy Advance games took advantage of features only fully supported on native GBA systems. Titles like Boktai that used the sunlight-sensor for gameplay would not function properly without the dedicated hardware. 
### Licensing Issues Affected Certain Ports and Remakes  
Complications with underlying software licenses also led to hiccups in some cases. For example, certain enhanced re-releases of **Pok√©mon Red/Blue/Yellow** were not compatible across all systems due to music copyright complexities.
### Unusual Peripherals Caused Incompatibilities 
Oddball accessories for certain games presented another edge case. Examples being Konami's Game Boy Tower vertical shooter **Gradius Spirits**, which required its unique mounting hardware to play properly.
## Part 7: In Conclusion
In summary, while the original Nintendo DS could play the immense Game Boy Advance library through backwards compatibility, it was unable to run games designed exclusively for the 8-bit Game Boy or Game Boy Color handhelds without workarounds. For the fullest backwards compatibility experience, Game Boy Advance systems remained the top choice overall for enjoying classics from Nintendo's portable video game history. However, advances in emulation technology have since enabled playing this vast retro library on newer devices as well.
