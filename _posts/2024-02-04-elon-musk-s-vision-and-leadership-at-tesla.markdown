### **The Technoking's Intense Interview Process** 
If interviewing for a critical role at Tesla, you will likely face Musk directly. He is not afraid to give critical feedback to ensure only the most capable and driven individuals join his team. Former hiring managers recall interviews with Musk being both nerve-wracking yet enlightening experiences. While intimidating in the moment, his no-nonsense approach ensured only the best talent made it through to help achieve Tesla's mission.
### **Securing Face Time with the Busy Entrepreneur**
As CEO of multiple companies, getting on Musk's schedule is no easy task. Employees described tight windows only available very late at night if they were fortunate. The surest way to grab his attention was by solving problems Musk himself was facing. His tightly-managed calendar meant persisting with daily emails for weeks on end in hopes of a response. Breaking through this barrier demonstrated sufficient motivation to join his revolutionary efforts.
### **Building the Future by Hand at Tesla's Startup Stage** 
In Tesla's early days, resources were scarce but dedication was not. One specialist recalled building the first five Falcon 1 rockets entirely by hand, working 100 hour weeks to help Musk's vision come to life. Through relentless self-driven efforts like this, the small founding team laid the groundwork that would eventually make Tesla the industry leader it is today. While exhausting, those who persevered gained invaluable experience helping shape a new era of electrified transportation.
### **Musk's Vision for a Multi-Planetary Future**
Beyond transforming the automotive industry, Musk's even grander ambitions include making humanity a multi-planetary species through SpaceX. With goals such as establishing a human colony on Mars, he aims to protect Earth's biosphere and minimize existential risks. For employees motivated by significant global challenges, working under Musk offered the potential for real impact through revolutionary innovations. His leadership has already pushed numerous industries forward and may help determine the long term future of our civilization.
### **The Power of Persevering through Relentless Work**
While the demands of Musk's leadership are not for the faint of heart, those who persevered through relentless 100 hour work weeks found it rewarding. Not only did they gain unmatched experience helping create entire industries from the ground up, they joined transformative efforts that may ultimately impact all of humanity. For the right candidates looking to be a part of history, overcoming challenges under Musk's visionary drive can be well worth it.
### **Musk's Ongoing Mission to Accelerate Sustainable Energy**
Over 15 years after Tesla's founding, Musk continues spearheading the company's efforts as they scale electric vehicles globally. His leadership persists in transforming transportation despite ongoing challenges and skeptics. Through tenacity and innovation, Tesla has proven electric cars can be faster, more affordable and practical than gas alternatives. As automakers rapidly electrify their lineups, Musk helped spark a sustainable mobility revolution that will define this century. His ambitious and entrepreneurial spirit remains a model for visionary leaders tackling humanity's most critical issues.
