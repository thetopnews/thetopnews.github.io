### Leaving Home and Battling Mental Health Challenges 
After graduating high school, I was excited to leave my small hometown and enroll at a coaching institute in Kota, Rajasthan to begin intensive JEE preparation. However, I quickly felt overwhelmed by the heavy coursework and high-stakes nature of the exam. Within a few months, I began struggling with depression, anxiety, and loneliness living away from family for the first time. Seeking an escape from the incessant pressure, I made some poor decisions and started **abusing prescription drugs** with other students also battling mental health issues. My addiction and grades steadily declined as I fell deeper into a dark place.

### Hitting Rock Bottom and Seeking Rehabilitation
After a year of struggling in Kota, I decided to return home in disgrace, full of regret and shame over my mistakes. Facing difficult emotions alone, I realized I needed professional help to recover. I courageously committed to a 6-month drug rehabilitation program where I slowly rebuilt my self-esteem through therapy and life coaching. During this challenging process, I regained clarity on my goals and rekindled my passion for engineering through hands-on projects.

Visualizing my dream outcome every day kept me focused and determined to overcome setbacks efficiently. Regular check-ins with counselors gave me an outlet to process emotions in a healthy way. Gradually, I regained confidence in my capabilities and believed wholeheartedly that achieving my goal was within reach through diligent effort.  
### Sharpening Skills for Exam Success
Over the next year, I diligently followed IITIANGUIDE's customized study plan and practice tests to systematically fill knowledge gaps. Practicing **timed mock exams** under exam-like conditions helped me identify weaknesses and boosted test-taking endurance. Feedback from mentors revealed areas for fine-tuning strategies and minimizing mistakes. On exam day, I felt fully prepared to tackle any question confidently thanks to rigorous preparation guided by experts.
