## Part 1: The Evolution of Online Gaming
### Early Days Without Fees
In the early days of home video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, **online multiplayer gaming was not possible**. Games were designed solely for local multiplayer using additional controllers. While online was in its infancy, **dedicated server costs were not a factor for console makers**.

### The Dawn of Online Play  
As internet connectivity became more widespread in homes, the newer PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast consoles introduced basic **online functionality through dial-up internet connections**. However, **online multiplayer was still in its infancy and added no recurring subscription costs for players**. Game developers focused on crafting fun offline multiplayer experiences first.
### Today's Landscape of Mandatory Fees
Fast forward to the modern era of PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch, and the gaming landscape looks much different. Now **nearly all multiplayer-focused titles require a paid online subscription** to access standard features like playing against friends online. Additionally, blockbuster franchises often lock key components of the full game experience behind these monthly paywalls.
## Part 2: The Case for Subscription Fees  
### Console Makers' Arguments
When confronted about the growing costs of gaming, console manufacturers point to the high expenses of **operating robust online infrastructure and dedicated servers worldwide**. They argue subscription fees are needed to cover these **significant ongoing operational costs associated with online services**.
### The Phantom "Free" Games  
An additional justification given is that monthly subscription plans offer players access to a curated selection of **"free"** games. However, critics argue the true cost of these games is already baked into subscription prices paid over time rather than truly being free.
## Part 3: Debunking the Cost Arguments
### Online Infrastructure Does Not Require Fees  
As evidence, platforms like **Steam and Epic Games store have proven robust online services can thrive without mandatory subscription costs passed onto players**. Instead, they generate profits through alternative means.
### High Dev Fees Already Line Pockets
Further, console makers extract a hefty **30% platform fee from every game and microtransaction sold**. For billion dollar franchises, these cumulative fees more than cover any necessary online running costs year after year.
### Games Proved Profitable Without Fees  
Franchises like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto saw record breaking sales and profitability throughout the 2000s without additional online subscription requirements. This reality refutes claims fees are an unavoidable necessity for online functionality.
## Part 4: Nostalgia for Simpler Times  
### Joy of Local Multiplayer is Lost
Many veteran gamers reminisce fondly about **LAN parties and gatherings to enjoy local multiplayer mayhem without extra ongoing fees**. This social aspect of gaming brought friends and family together for fun rather than revenue generation.
### Games Used to be Made With Passion
Prior to the current emphasis on **hyper-monetization and chase for maximum profits**, developers had more freedom to craft experiences driven first and foremost by a passion for their creative visions rather than strict profit quotas. This showed in the high quality of even free multiplayer offerings.
## Part 5: Questionable Anti-Consumer Practices
### Perpetual Rental Model Concerns  
With subscription-based access, consumers are relegated to long term **rental of games they technically own**, subject to price hikes or loss of access entirely if payments lapse. This undermines the benefits of true ownership.
### Ongoing Price Creep Across Generations  
Each new console generation introduces **even more additional costs and fees stacked on top of already expensive hardware purchases**. From Xbox Live Gold to PlayStation Plus, and now costly standalone controllers, costs continue rising rapidly with each new system. 
### Future Risk of Unbundling Essential Parts
There is understandable worry that in pursuing profits further, platforms may one day decide to wholly **unbundle online features, accounts or cloud saves from base hardware sales**. Forcing piecemeal purchasing risks fragmenting the user experience.
## Part 6: Growing Voice for Reform  
### Mounting Frustration Over "Non-Essential" Fees  
As costs pile ever higher, an increasingly vocal faction of disgruntled gamers sees subscription charges not as necessary **operational expenses but as profit grabs without adding material value**.
### Situation Feels Driven By Greed, Not Need
When objective analysis pokes holes in platforms' arguments, it fuels perceptions the **true motivation is maximizing revenue extraction rather than sincerely needing extra funds to maintain services realistically**.
### Hopes Platforms Will Address Player Demands  
With a fervent, loyal user base, there is hope well-coordinated calls for more consumer-friendly options will force the hands of platform holders over time to adopt pricing structures reflecting **fair access and choice rather than mandatory draining subscription models**.
## Part 7: The Punishing Cost of Admission 
### $60 Game Prices Plus Fees Are Burdensome   
At $60 a pop regularly, purchasing top games **each month or season** presents a significant recurring cost commitment on its own, **made worse by mandatory additional subscription costs every year**.
### Forced Online Fees Feel Economically Unfair
When multiplayer functions as intrinsic to a title as its single-player modes, tacking on extra compulsory subscription pricing comes across to some as an **exploitative cash grab undermining the full value of games legally purchased**.
### Possible Future of Stripped-Down Hardware
Looking ahead, there is legitimate fear consoles may one day ship with key controller or multimedia components sold **separately in an "unbundled" model maximizing short term profits at the expense of customers' experience and control over ownership.**
## Part 8: Summary - Reorienting Priorities
### Online Can and Should Be Affordable and Accessible  
As demonstrated by fee-free competitors, **well-run online services do not inherently necessitate additional recurring fees bundled onto hardware costs and game prices already generating billions annually**. 
### Platforms Profit Enormously from High Dev Share Alone  
With the consecutive record-breaking revenues of each generation and their 30% platform tax, **there should be no doubt platforms earn more than enough from current structures to cover online without nickel and diming players**.
### Gaming Used to Put Fun Over Profits  
Nostalgic longtime fans recall a time when **top priority was how to most creatively engage players rather than elaborate systems ensuring constant revenue extraction and investment returns quarter over quarter**.
### Players Just Want Fair Costs and Choice Over Spending
At the end of the day, most consumers simply want the option for **affordable access to their favorite games and friends online without artificial constraints or non-optional additional charges tacked onto already substantial investment requirements**.
## Part 9: Conclusion - A Return to Player-Centric Practices
### Competition Proves Reform Is Possible   
With growing third-party digital storefronts demonstrating positive alternatives, it's clear **thriving online play does not inherently warrant subscriptions or high ancillary costs if platforms make different priorities and profit structures possible**. 
### Subscriptions Should Remain Optional   
For a sustainable, consumer-focused future, **online multiplaying going back to being a free included feature of game purchases rather than a costly add-on feels like the best consumer-first path forward for accessibility, choice and fairness for all players**.
### Refocus on Creative Passion Over Monetization Angles
By relaxing unsustainable pressure to maximize extra monetization of every aspect, platforms could empower developers to once again pour energy into **innovative works enhancing the art form rather than constrained by profitability mandates standing in the way of new ideas or risk taking**. This would benefit players and industry alike.
