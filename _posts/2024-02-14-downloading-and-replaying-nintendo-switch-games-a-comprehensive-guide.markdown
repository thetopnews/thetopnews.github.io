### **Re-downloading Previously Purchased Digital Games** 
As long as you purchased a digital Nintendo Switch game through the Nintendo eShop digital storefront or received a review copy, you can re-download that title to your Nintendo Switch at no additional charge. Your digital game library is linked to your Nintendo account rather than the physical console, so you can download purchased games across multiple Switch systems. To access your game library, sign in to the Nintendo eShop with the account used to make the original purchase. From there, you can select any previously purchased digital games and initiate the download. This allows Switch owners flexibility to re-download favorite games even if they upgrade to a new model or need to perform a system update or reset.

### **Playing Single-Player Games Across Multiple User Profiles**
The Nintendo Switch supports multiple user profiles on a single console. This enables different family members to have their own personalized profile. You can play downloaded digital games across user profiles, but each profile stores separate save data. For example, if you start a new game of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on another profile, you will need to begin from the beginning rather than continuing your existing save file. Game saves are not transferable between profiles on the same Switch. However, this user-specific save data does not restrict playing the actual game itself across profiles once downloaded.
### **Building Your Digital Game Library Through the Nintendo eShop** 
Nintendo provides an easy way for Switch owners to expand their software collection directly from the console through the Nintendo eShop digital marketplace. Most games require a one-time paid purchase using funds added to your Nintendo account. But the eShop also offers several free-to-play options like the massively popular **Fortnite Battle Royale game** which does not require any upfront spending. Timed game demos and trials are available too, allowing you to sample titles before committing to a purchase. This gives Switch users flexibility to discover new games directly on their device via the curated eShop storefront.
### **Understanding the Legal Risks of Unauthorized Game Downloads**
While pirated Nintendo Switch game ROMs, or "ROMs", can sometimes be found through unofficial download sites, installing them would constitute **copyright infringement** and is strongly discouraged. Nintendo actively protects its intellectual property and enforces against piracy. Unauthorized game files also pose malware and security risks since they could enable hacking of the Nintendo Switch console in violation of its intended usage policies. **Jailbreaking a Switch** voids the device's warranty and updates may block custom firmware, rendering pirated titles unplayable. Supporting developers through official storefronts like the Nintendo eShop helps ensure a steady stream of high-quality original games and ports.
### **Requirements for Installing Custom Firmware** 
In order to play pirated Nintendo Switch game ROMs, it would first be necessary to install unauthorized "custom firmware" which removes the standard usage restrictions and security features of the officially released Nintendo Switch operating system. However, creating or distributing custom firmware can infringe on intellectual property rights without permission from the platform holder. The process of **installing custom Switch firmware** also introduces various legal and technical risks like voiding the device's warranty or blocking future firmware updates which could break compatibility for pirated content. Overall it's not worth the potential downsides when abundant legitimate gaming options exist through proper channels.
### **Legal Alternatives for Homebrew Content**
Some hobbyist communities share homebrew software and small games made independently from commercial titles. A few websites curate legal homebrew content that can be installed on a Nintendo Switch running custom firmware, albeit still an unauthorized configuration. However, downloading and playing actual Switch game ROMs without a valid license remains illegal regardless of any homebrew activities, which should solely involve independent non-commercial software. While certain communities enable limited homebrew experimentation, legal alternatives exist through the official eShop for enjoying both major commercial releases and independent titles developed through approved publisher programs.
### **Devolver Digital's Commitment to Quality Games Like Enter the Gungeon**
One indie publisher consistently delivering excellent Switch ports is Devolver Digital, known for offbeat comedy titles. Devolver fostered the original PC release of the beloved **roguelike bullet hell game Enter the Gungeon** which then saw a polished console adaptation for Switch. With charming 16-bit retro pixel graphics and a heavy emphasis on procedural generation, Enter the Gungeon provides endless replayability in its dungeon delving gun combat across successive runs. Devolver's quirky style shines through with references to their catalog throughout Gungeon's unlockable weapons and characters, rewarding players familiar with beloved Devolver published games like Serious Sam or Hotline Miami. 
### **Critical Acclaim and Enduring Popularity for Enter the Gungeon**
Upon releasing for Switch in 2017, Enter the Gungeon was met with widespread critical praise for its tough but fair gameplay mechanics and depth of content for the low price of $14.99. Reviewers celebrated its challenge of mastering randomized enemy encounters through strategizing weapon and item builds across the procedurally generated floors. With over 1,000 possible guns, alternate ending paths, and constant updates adding further secrets and features, devoted players spent months discovering everything Gungeon had to offer. To this day the game maintains an active player base and is recommended as one of the best indie roguelikes on Switch thanks to its well-balanced, highly replayable formula that rewards persistence from newcomers and experts alike.
### **Flexibility and Support in the Digital Age**
Modern consoles provide Switch owners welcome convenience and flexibility through digital games libraries not tied to physical media or hardware. Nintendo's eShop enables browsing, purchasing, and re-downloading titles wherever an internet connection exists. While piracy risks legal issues and offers inferior experiences, supporting creators through authorized storefronts uplifts the entire gaming medium. Independent developers in particular rely on fair sales to justify investing time into polished Switch ports. Overall, digital distribution brings welcome choice and value when appreciated responsibly and leveraged for licensed content only.
### **In Summary**
To conclude, the Nintendo Switch platform gives users access to a huge library of quality games through official digital storefronts while balancing flexible options like family-shared profiles and re-downloading past purchases. Unauthorized copying or modding of the Switch void important consumer protections and undermine the creative industries. When playing within intended usage policies, Nintendo and their publishing partners deliver top-tier experiences perfect for all ages that can provide entertainment for years on end. Purchasing through approved stores respects creators and ensures the future of the medium.
