## Part 1: Start With a Wired Connection 
Having a wired ethernet connection is one of the most important steps you can take to reduce lag when using PS5 Remote Play. **A wired network connection** provides a much more reliable connection compared to wireless, ensuring a smooth and lag-free experience. An ethernet cable directly from your router to both your PS5 console and the PS4 you want to stream allows for the most stable connection possible. 
Wireless connections are prone to interference from things like walls, appliances, and other electronics that can degrade and affect the signal over time. A wired connection eliminates these issues for consistently fast speeds. Some users also find that wired avoids potential issues from network security settings that can sometimes restrict wireless traffic between devices on a home network. 
For the best results, it's recommended to hardwire both your PS5 and PS4 systems directly to your router or network switch using ethernet cables. This provides an uninterrupted line of communication between the devices for lag-free and seamless PS5 Remote Play.
### Check Your Ethernet Cable Speed
Don't forget to also check that your ethernet cables support the necessary bandwidth. Older or damaged cables may not have the throughput needed, so use Cat5e or higher rated cables for gigabit connectivity. The small investment is worth it for an undisturbed wired experience.

## Part 2: Make Sure Devices Are on the Same Network  
In order to use PS5 Remote Play between different rooms in your home, it's crucial that both your PS5 console and PS4 are connected to the **same local area network (LAN)**. Problems can occur if they are on separate subnets or networks. 
Be sure to check your router settings and ensure both devices are connecting to the same WiFi network name. Some routers are capable of broadcasting multiple networks on different channels, so double check your PS4 and PS5 are linking to the primary network. You don't want one device connecting to a secondary network name by accident.
It's also a good idea to assign your consoles static IP addresses within the router configuration. This prevents any issues down the line if one system is dynamically assigned a new IP that loses connection to the main network. Setting static addresses ensures they are always reachable on your home network.
### Test Connectivity Between Rooms  
Do a quick test that your systems can communicate by initiating file transfers or remote play between the two locations. This confirms there are no isolated subnets preventing connectivity before you start streaming games. Address any hiccups at the network level first.
## Part 3: Optimize Your Network Settings  
One key factor influencing the quality of your PS5 Remote Play experience is your network settings and how they handle communication between devices. Taking some time to optimize a few settings can go a long way in reducing lag.
One important setting is ensuring your PS5 has an **Open NAT Type**, also referred to as NAT Type 1. The Nat setting controls how well your network allows traffic between external sources. Having an Open NAT means optimal two-way communication without restrictions that could lead to lag spikes during streaming. 
Configuring Port Forwarding on your router is often necessary to achieve an Open NAT. This process opens specific ports that the PlayStation systems use to communicate seamlessly. Look up your router make and model online for step-by-step port forwarding instructions. An hour spent here can pay off tremendously.
### Prioritize PlayStation Traffic
Some advanced routers also allow for options like Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize traffic. Using QoS, you can set PlayStation traffic as high priority over things like network updates or downloads. This ensures critical game data is sent without waiting behind less important traffic that could otherwise cause lag spikes during busy network times.
## Part 4: Manage Other Device Usage 
Avoiding network congestion is important for smooth and lag-free PS5 Remote Play. Having a lot of other traffic competing for bandwidth can easily disrupt your streaming experience. 
During remote sessions, it's best to limit use of bandwidth-intensive activities from other connected devices wherever possible. Things like large downloads, 4K video streaming, online gaming by other household members, and multiple concurrent smart device usage should be avoided or postponed if possible.
Even everyday activities like browsing the web or checking social media can add up when combined across several devices. Be conscious of overall network load, especially if you have a slower copper internet connection with limited throughput. 
When bandwidth demands are highest, remote play may experience more intermittent lag or quality drops. **Schedule heavy downloads** overnight instead of during play sessions when possible. Pause 4K streaming on other TVs to free up bandwidth for lag-free PS5 Remote Play.
### Use Multiple WiFi Bands 
If available, use separate WiFi bands to isolate PlayStation traffic. For example, connecting your PS5 and PS4 to a dedicated 5GHz band while other devices use 2.4GHz can help prioritize important game data. Consider upgrading to a newer dual-band or tri-band router for improved bandwidth management capabilities.
## Part 5: Perform Speed Tests
A great way to assess any potential network-related lag sources is to run dedicated speed tests between locations. This helps identify physical barriers or capacity issues affecting your connection quality.
Using apps like Speedtest by Ookla, test upload/download speeds from both the PS5 and PS4 locations to your router. Look for consistency across all tests as well as minimum speeds of at least 15Mbps up/down for a good quality stream. Too low and lag will intrude on gameplay. 
Also pay attention to latency, or response times, shown in milliseconds (ms). Under 50ms in each direction is ideal for lag-free performance. Higher latency indicates slow signal propagation through connections and infrastructure that will cause lag spikes during remote play. 
Check for differences using a wired versus wireless connection on one device. If wireless struggles, use Ethernet cabling instead to eliminate the wireless link as a potential culprit. 
### Evaluate Router Placement
The placement of your router within the home also matters greatly. Receiving a strong WiFi signal requires line-of-sight to the router or using the shortest wall-passing path possible for best throughput. Too many interior walls can weaken signals leading to increased latency and quality drops during gameplay.
## Part 6: Consider a Network Upgrade
If speed tests continue showing lower than ideal readings or longstanding issues persist, it may be time for a network hardware upgrade. Older home routers can struggle to keep up with modern demands, especially when simultaneous streaming and gaming are involved. 
Investing in a new **dual-band or tri-band mesh WiFi system** can solve connectivity problems across a larger area. Mesh networks maintain stable connections by using multiple wireless access points that work together seamlessly. 
Gigabit routers with advanced QoS controls and additional bands are optimized for busy households with multiple concurrent high-bandwidth activities. Newer 802.11ac and WiFi 6 routers deliver faster aggregated speeds across more devices simultaneously than older hardware. 
For whole-home coverage, running Ethernet cabling to additional wireless access points delivers rock-solid reliability. Or consider a true mesh network where nodes communicate wirelessly to blanket your space. Either option ensures strong signals anywhere you want to remotely play. 
Many mesh kits now provide app controls to prioritize gaming devices automatically for seamless gameplay from any room. A network refresh may be required to fully eliminate laggy performance issues once and for all.
## Part 7: Tweak Remote Play Settings
While having a great network foundation is key, don't forget about your PS5's own remote play video and audio settings. Fine-tuning these based on your connection capabilities often leads to an even better experience. 
Start by testing different resolution and framerate options within the remote play settings menu. For most home networks, **1080p resolution at 30-60fps usually provides the optimal balance of quality and responsiveness without taxing your connection.**
Likewise, toggling HDR and 4K can introduce unnecessary latency if your network isn't up to the bandwidth demand. Stick with standard dynamic range initially until speeds improve. 
The automatic or manual adjustment slider also allows finding the right compromise between highest possible quality or most minimal latency. Most casual players prefer trailing just a bit in quality for seamless, lag-free control responsiveness. 
With some experimentation based on observed performance, you can dial in the customized remote play configuration that works best over your specific network conditions. Small tweaks go a long way towards reducing lag and improving the experience.
