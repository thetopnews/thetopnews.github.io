## Getting Set Up with EA 
With EA Access launching on PlayStation 4 next month, here's a guide on setting up your EA account and linking it to your PlayStation Network (PSN) profile to take advantage of the subscription gaming service. 
### Creating an EA Account
Creating an EA account is similar to setting up a PSN ID. **Visitors will need to provide basic contact information like their email address and create a password that meets the account's security requirements.** The registration process should only take a few minutes. Be sure to keep track of your login credentials in a safe place for future access to your EA profile and games.

### Linking EA to PSN
To sync your EA games and profile with your PlayStation, you'll need to connect your EA account to your PSN profile. From the EA website, navigate to the "Link Account" section and select PlayStation Network as the platform. Enter your PSN online ID and the process will tie the two services together. This linking enables features like automatically logging into your EA profile when playing supported titles on PS4.
## PlayStation Plus not Mandatory for EA Access  
While a PlayStation Plus membership provides benefits like online multiplayer and monthly games on PlayStation consoles, it is not required to take advantage of EA Access.
### EA Account & Features without PS Plus
You can create an EA account and link it to your PSN ID without an active PS Plus subscription. **Basic EA Access functionality like accessing the vault of games and offline single-player modes will work without PS Plus.**
### PS Plus Still Needed for Most Online Play
While EA Access itself does not demand a PS Plus membership, the standalone online components of EA titles will typically mandate PS Plus, similar to other publishers' games. There are exceptions, but for the most part, a PS Plus subscription is necessary for **online gaming features like multiplayer modes, competitive play, and online co-op.**
## Prompted to Set Up EA Upon Launching Supported Games
Once EA Access launches on PS4 and players start playing supported online-enabled EA titles, they may encounter prompts to sign in or create an EA account if one is not already linked to their PSN profile.
### Signing In Across Platforms  
With a single EA account, gamers can associate their profile with multiple platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, PC and mobile. **This offers convenience in carrying game progress and achievements between systems.**
### One PSN to One EA Linking
It's important to note that while one EA account can be connected to several PlayStation, Xbox or other accounts, a single PSN ID can only be linked to one EA profile.
## Subscription Access to EA's Video Game Library
At its core, EA Access provides access to Electronic Arts' extensive catalog of games through a low-cost monthly or annual subscription. 
### subscription EA Access Membership 
For $4.99 per month or $29.99 annually in the US, the EA Access membership grants players unlimited access to play more than 60 **AAA titles like Madden, Battlefield, Mass Effect, and Star Wars games** from EA's library. 
### Expanding to PS4 in July
Following the service's succesful launch on Xbox consoles in 2014, **EA has now announced EA Access will be coming to PlayStation 4 starting in July 2019** based on reports from reputable gaming websites and publications.
### No Individual Game Purchases
Rather than buying each EA game at full price, the subscription acts as a "Netflix for games" offering instant access to the vault. Members can also preview unreleased titles before launch and receive exclusive discounts on EA digital purchases.
## Benefits of Waiting for the July Launch
With the official EA Access launch on PS4 scheduled for next month, potential subscribers have reason to hold off on purchasing games individually.
### Access to Library for Low Fee
Instead of spending $60 per title, gamers can get access to over 60 EA games in the vault for just $4.99 a month or $30 annually through the subscription. 
### Reliable July Launch Reports  
Sources like PlayStation Blog, IGN, GameSpot and more have **cited EA's own announcement confirming the July rollout on PS4.** With established industry sites corroborating the date, it seems very likely Access will indeed debut next month as planned.
### Try Before You Buy 
As with Xbox, the service allows PlayStation owners to try out new EA games before committing to a full purchase. This provides value in evaluating games before spending money on them.
## Signing Up for EA Access in July
Once EA Access is officially available on PS4 in July, here are the simple steps to subscribe and start enjoying access to Electronic Arts' library of games.
### Subscribe via PlayStation Store
Players can sign up for EA Access directly through the PlayStation Store on their PS4. **Look for the EA Access application and select the subscription duration and payment option.**
