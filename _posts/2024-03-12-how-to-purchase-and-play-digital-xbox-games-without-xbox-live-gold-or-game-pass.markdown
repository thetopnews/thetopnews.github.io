Purchasing and playing digital games on the Xbox console is made easy through the Microsoft Store. While Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass provide valuable additional benefits, they are not strictly required to buy or enjoy digital games. This comprehensive guide will cover all the necessary steps to obtain and enjoy games digitally without needing an ongoing subscription.
###Part 1: Setting Up Your Microsoft Account
Your Microsoft Account serves as your digital identity when accessing services like the Microsoft Store. To start purchasing games, you'll first need to create or sign into an existing account. Be sure to provide basic contact details and choose a strong password during account setup for security. 
Once signed in, link a preferred payment method like a credit/debit card, PayPal account, or Xbox gift cards for making purchases. Having payment info readily available will streamline the checkout process later on. You may also opt to save address details for order and delivery purposes if buying physical goods in the future.
###Part 2: **Browsing for Games in the Microsoft Store** 
Launch the Microsoft Store directly from your Xbox console or visit store.microsoft.com using another connected device. Browse featured new releases, top sellers, and genres to discover potential game selections. Filter search results by **["kid-friendly games"**,"action games"] and other relevant **longtail keywords** to quickly zoom in on appealing options. 
The store frontend serves up title cards displaying key info like ratings, screenshots, descriptions, and price. Clicking through gives more granular details on game modes, features, requirements and developer background. User and professional reviews provide valuable purchase influencing perspectives. Add games to your Wishlist for easy retrieval later during the buying process.
###Part 3: **Making the Purchase**
Once a game is selected, click the "Get" or "Buy" button to initiate checkout. If you previously linked a payment method, simply confirm purchase details. Otherwise, provide billing info on the ensuing screen. Upon successful payment processing, the game will show as "Purchased" in your Library and be ready for download.
No Xbox Live membership is involved at this stage. You've now acquired full ownership rights to install and access the game through your Microsoft Account forever, regardless of subscription status. A digital purchase entitles you to redownload the title anytime onto any Xbox device linked to that account.
###Part 4: **Downloading and Launching the Game**  
From the Microsoft Store on Xbox, look for the game in your Library tab. Select it to start the download which may take time depending on file size and your internet connection speeds. Console storage space must be sufficient or you can transfer games between internal and external hard drives as needed. 
Once fully installed, simply launch the game tile from your Library or homepage. Without an active Xbox Live Gold membership, you can enjoy all **single-player and offline multiplayer modes**. However, any features requiring an online connection like **competitive multiplayer matches** will be inaccessible until subscribing to Gold.
###Part 5: **Additional Benefits of Xbox Live Gold**
While not essential for basic game purchases and play, an Xbox Live Gold subscription unlocks valuable extras worth considering:
- **Access to online multiplayer** - Compete against others worldwide in supported games.
- **Free Games with Gold** - Each month includes high-quality backwards compatible Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles to download and keep as part of the subscription. 
- **Exclusive discounts** - Deals and sales offer extra savings on DLC, add-ons, and select new games. 
- **Cloud game saves** - Automatic uploads preserve your progress if something happens to your console. 
Bundled with the above Gold perks, **Xbox Game Pass provides the best value**, granting access to over 100 titles downloadable on demand for a low monthly fee. New releases are frequently added too.
###Part 6: **Alternative Purchase Channels**
While the Xbox console Microsoft Store delivers seamless gameplay, consider these supplemental purchase options:
- **Microsoft Store web/apps** - Browse and acquire games on any internet-connected PC, tablet or phone for console library access.
- **Physical disc games** - Buy or rent game discs and install from disc instead of downloading. Requires the disc to play. 
- **Retailer websites/stores** - Popular shops like Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop and others sell digital Xbox codes redeemable online.
- **Xbox gift cards** - Purchase pre-paid plastic or e-gift cards to fund Microsoft Store transactions flexibly.
###Part 7: **Maintaining Your Purchases**  
To keep full control over your purchased content:
- **Stay signed into your Microsoft Account** - Automatic sign-ins preserve payment methods and game libraries. 
- **Back up save files regularly** - The cloud is best but local USB backups preserve precious progress if needed.
- **Keep console software up to date** - Updates ensure compatibility and fix bugs so games keep working as intended.
- **Contact support if needed** - Microsoft can help with account issues or restoring access to games in some situations.
Overall, careful account management safeguards permanent access to your digital Xbox software investments made without Xbox Live memberships.
###Part 8: **Conclusion**
In summary, Xbox gamers need only their Microsoft Account and a payment method to purchase and play most digital games without Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass subscriptions.
