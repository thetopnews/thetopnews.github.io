### Why I Chose the Backbone Over the PSP
Sony had conveyed they were not focused on portable gaming anymore and actually endorsed third-party options like the Backbone instead. While expensive, the Backbone seemed like a worthwhile investment for seamless remote play on the go. It convinced me it was the best option available to continue enjoying my PS games outside of the living room.

### Initial Impressions of the PSP Announcement
When Sony finally announced the PSP, it came across as a half-hearted attempt at remote play more than a true portable gaming device. It didn't seem to adequately address the limitations of using a phone for remote gaming. By the time of its announcement, I had already invested in the Backbone which provided a similar function, so the PSP was not a compelling upgrade option.
### Comparing Key Features and Specs
One major advantage the Backbone has is support for **mobile game streaming and using mobile data networks**, allowing gaming anywhere with a cellular connection. While the PSP does have a slightly larger screen, its lack of true **pocketability** is a downside. The Backbone is lighter but long play sessions may be more comfortable on the PSP. Both have **Sony-style button layouts** but the PSP touchscreen comes with limitations.
### Battery Life Realities 
While the PSP battery life may match that of the DualSense controller, it likely won't last through multiple hours-long **remote play sessions** like the Backbone can on a phone charge. Using Bluetooth headphones instead of a proprietary connection is also preferable. Getting 6-7 hours of play time with sound and brightness adjusted shows the flexibility of the phone-based solution.
### Options for Multiple Game Platforms
One of my favorite aspects of the Backbone is that it allows me to not only play my PS games but also access my whole **Game Pass library and other subscription services**.The PSP is strictly limited to Sony's PlayStation Remote Play feature. I appreciate keeping my options open across different ecosystems.
### Not Enough Upgrades to Justify the Cost 
The few improvements the PSP offered, like the larger screen, seemed minor for the full price of another dedicated portable system. As someone who had already chosen an alternative peripheral providing comparable functionality, there wasn't a compelling value proposition to the PSP. Sony would have had to deliver more revolutionary upgrades to earn another big purchase from me at that point.
### Preferences for Active Platforms
At the end of the day, I want to play games from platforms being strongly supported with new releases. While I still enjoy digging up old consoles and games from my history, they can't be my primary way to game. I prefer spending time with systems receiving ongoing content, updates and third party support.
### Sticking with What Works For Me
Unless Remote Play sees major and system-wide improvements, the Backbone mobile controller accessory will remain my go-to option for portable PlayStation gaming over an actual PSP device. Its flexibility to also work with other platforms like Game Pass adds value. For now, I'm satisfied with my established portable gaming setup and won't be upgrading to the PSP.
