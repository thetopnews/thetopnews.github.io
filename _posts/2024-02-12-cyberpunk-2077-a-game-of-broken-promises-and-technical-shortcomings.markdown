## Setting Unrealistic Expectations through Overly Ambitious Marketing 
### **Unprecedented Pre-Orders and Hype for an Open-World Sci-Fi RPG**
Cyberpunk 2077 received over eight million pre-orders in its first day, setting the record at the time for most pre-ordered PC game ever. This was largely due to the hype surrounding developer CD Projekt Red and their acclaimed open-world fantasy RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In the lead-up to Cyberpunk 2077's release, the developer made **bold claims** about the technical scope and features players could expect across multiple hardware platforms.

### **Ambiguous Development Timelines and Delayed Releases** 
However, signs of trouble began emerging as Cyberpunk 2077 suffered multiple delays pushing its release date further back. Originally planned for an April 2020 launch, it was first pushed to September 2020 and then again to November 2020. As delays mounted, focus shifted towards next-generation console versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S slated for a later 2021 release. This ambiguous development timeline caused many to speculate whether the game was truly ready for its initial planned launch.
## A Disastrous Debut on Last-Gen Consoles
### **Virtually Unplayable on Base PS4 and Xbox One Hardware**
When Cyberpunk 2077 finally launched in December 2020, the base PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were nearly **unoptimized open-world RPG**. The game struggled to maintain a stable framerate and suffered from numerous visual bugs like texture pop-in issues. Quests and NPC interactions were also plagued by progression-stopping bugs and glitches. 
### **Save Corruption Issues Plagued All Platforms** 
While PC and next-gen console versions experienced better performance, no version of Cyberpunk 2077 was exempt from the multitude of software issues at launch. Game-breaking bugs involving corrupted saves frequently ruined player progress across all hardware. This damaged the core experience of any role-playing game that relies on investment in a single consistent narrative playthrough.
### **Unprecedented PlayStation Store Removal**
The troubled state of Cyberpunk 2077 on base consoles drew the ire of players and media alike. Sony took the drastic step of removing the game entirely from the PlayStation Store, offering full refunds to any customers that purchased a digital copy. This unprecedented move highlighted just how broken the game's last-gen versions truly were on release.
## Widespread Backlash from Misled Customers
### **Outrage Over Broken Promises and Misleading Marketing**
In the aftermath of Cyberpunk 2077's botched launch, players understandably expressed frustration over CD Projekt Red's unrealistic promises for their game's technical capabilities on older hardware. This led to a massive wave of criticism and "review bombs" targeting the game across review aggregation sites like Metacritic. 
### **Automatic Refund Policies to Appease Unhappy Customers** 
Both Sony and other digital storefronts implemented temporary automatic refund policies for anyone who bought Cyberpunk 2077 on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. This was an attempt to appease the tidal wave of customers who felt misled by the game's marketing material and disappointed by its poor technical state on their consoles of choice.
### **Tarnished Reputation and Lost Goodwill Going Forward** 
The damage to CD Projekt Red's credibility and goodwill with consumers from this whole ordeal may never fully recover. While Cyberpunk 2077 still managed to sell strongly despite the backlash, future projects from the studio now come with built-in skepticism over whether ambitious plans can be realistically delivered upon.
## A Long Road to Recovery Through Post-Launch Support 
### **Continued Struggles to Optimize for Last-Gen Hardware** 
Over a year after its tumultuous launch, Cyberpunk 2077 still exhibited various technical issues when played on base PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles through 2021. While periodic updates and hotfixes helped address some problems, core performance remained a struggle on the dated hardware it was falsely advertised to run well on.
### **Free DLC and Expansions Aim to Revive Interest**  
In an effort to redeem themselves with customers, CD Projekt Red continuously supports Cyberpunk 2077 with free DLC expansions, patches, and quality-of-life improvements. Upcoming expansions could bolster the gameplay and renew some interest, but persistent bugs leave lasting doubts about the developer's ability to properly support this technically **demanding open-world RPG** long-term. 
### **Acquisitions May Alter Development Philosophy**
Recent studio acquisitions signal CD Projekt Red's ambitions may be shifting towards shorter, more manageable development cycles. Only time will tell if their renewed approach can help win back consumer confidence while also prioritizing sustainable working conditions for their workforce who endured crunch to ship the botched original release.
Cyberpunk 2077's disastrous launch taught the industry a hard lesson about overpromising on technical features before a game is fully polished and optimized. While sales proved consumer appetite for ambitious sci-fi worlds, it came at great cost to one developer's credibility building realistic expectations and meeting them at launch. With commitment to long-term support, perhaps Cyberpunk 2077's reputation may one day recover from its broken beginnings.
