### Blocking Prevents Direct Contact
Blocking someone on social media prevents that person from seeing your posts and sending you direct messages. **When you block a contact, it places restrictions on their ability to directly interact with and view your online activities.** The blocked user will be unable to see anything you share, and any messages they send will not be delivered due to the active block. However, blocking does not prevent the blocked person from seeing your public profile or posts. It merely blocks direct communication between you and the blocked user.

### The Effects of Blocking Are Mutual
The restrictions of blocking apply equally to both parties - **the blocking user and the blocked user.** So if User A blocks User B, then User B will be unable to see User A's posts, view their profile, or send direct messages. And User A will not receive any messages from User B due to the active block between them. This ensures blocking removes the ability for direct interaction in both directions between the two social media profiles. It is important to note that blocking does not affect whether the users can see each other publicly or take any separate actions against one another.
### Messages from Blocked Accounts Go Undelivered  
Even if a blocked user sends a message, it will not be delivered to the blocking user's inbox due to the restrictions placed by the active block. **Any attempts at direct communication like messages, comments, or @mentions from a blocked profile will fail to go through.** The blocking mechanism aims to fully prevent a blocked individual from contacting or interacting with the blocking user's social media presence in any direct way. So users can feel secure knowing blocked parties cannot bypass the block through messaging or other direct attempts at contact.
### Reviewing Your Blocked Contacts
While blocking successfully bars direct interaction, it doesn't completely remove the blocked profiles from view. You can still manually check the profiles of blocked users to review their posts if you choose. On some platforms, you have the option to view a list of all currently blocked accounts as well. **Periodically reviewing blocked contacts allows assessing if any blocks should potentially be removed over time, such as if an issue was resolved or the relationship has changed.** Always keep blocked lists tuned by removing any contacts no longer posing issues to maintain clean blocking configurations. 
### Preventing Block Misuse 
Like any online tool, blocking capabilities could potentially be misused in harmful ways. To curb misuse, platforms may have policies against improperly over-blocking others or blocking without cause. They may also support appealing blocks if felt to be unwarranted. **However, the primary goal of blocking features is to enable users to curate their own online experiences and feel in control over who can directly contact them on social networks.** With responsible use, blocking delivers on empowering privacy options for protecting online social interactions.
### Alternative Contact Methods   
While blocking prevents direct interaction through a profile, there are sometimes alternative ways blocked users may attempt contact. For example, sending a direct message request via a shared connection or finding other publicly visible contact details could allow indirect communication bypassing the block. **However, persistent attempts at contacting a blocking user against their consent could undermine the intended privacy that blocking provides and may qualify as online harassment.** Generally, respecting an active block and avoiding indirect end-runs around it shows consideration for the blocking user's online boundaries.
### Lifting Blocks After Resolving Issues
Over time, the reasons for placing blocks may change as situations evolve. **Blocked connections represent past issues that are no longer a present concern once addressed or forgiven.** Occasionally reviewing blocked lists allows removing connections where the underlying problems leading to the block have been resolved through discussion, an apology, or with the passage of time healing hurt feelings. This keeps blocked contact lists tailored to current rather than past circumstances. Plus, it fosters an environment where former issues can overcome be overcome through open communication whenever feasible and safe.  
### Asking to Lift Blocks Respectfully   
On the other hand, blocked users also have options if they feel a block was wrongly applied or could now be lifted. Some platforms support sending block removal requests that go to the blocking user for review. When sending such requests, **it is always best to demonstrate understanding for why the block occurred previously and give space without pressure rather than demand the removal.** Providing a respectful explanation for why the request is being made and why the block is no longer necessary promotes thoughtful consideration of removing blocks in appropriate scenarios.
### Blocking Promotes Healthy Boundaries Online  
At the end of the day, core social media functions like direct messaging, comments, and mentions rely on mutual consent between participants. Blocking provides an empowering way for users to set virtual boundaries for keeping interactions within comfortable limits online, just as they would in person. **With blocking, individuals achieve more control over curating safe, harassment-free social experiences tailored to their preferences and needs.** As long as the tool is utilized responsibly, blocking represents a net positive capability for maintaining healthy online dynamics and relationships on social networks.
