### **Transferring Saved Game Data and Deleting Files Easily With Your USB Drive**
PS4 makes it simple to move saved game files between the console's internal storage and an external USB flash drive. Here are the basic steps to copy or delete game save files:
To copy game saves to your PS4, go to **Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data in System Storage.** You'll see a list of all your saved games. Select the ones you want to copy by pressing the Options button, then choose "Copy to USB Storage Device." **The PlayStation 4 will now copy the selected saved game files to your USB flash drive for safekeeping or transferring to another console.** 
Removing saved games is also straightforward. From the same Application Saved Data Management menu, select "Saved Data on USB Storage Device" and navigate to the games you want to delete. Press Options again and select "Delete" to permanently remove the saved files. Just be sure not to delete any saves you still want!

### **Understanding File Type Support For Transfers Between PS4 and USB Drive** 
While the PlayStation 4 allows saving games and basic file transfers with a USB flash drive, it is important to note that not all file formats can be used. The PS4 primarily supports saving game data and transferring documents like save files, game settings, captured screenshots, themes, and avatars. However, common media files like photos, videos, and music usually cannot be directly moved on and off the console.
For example, compressed audio files in MP3 or AAC format will not play directly from a USB drive plugged into the PS4. Likewise, image files in JPG, PNG or other formats cannot be viewed within the console's gallery apps. So while flash drives are convenient for game saves, you need alternate methods to watch movies, listen to playlists or view pictures on the PS4.
### **Uploading Files From USB to PS4 Online Storage**  
While a USB drive is great for local file storage and transfers, the PlayStation 4 also offers online storage space that's accessible from any system you're signed into. To upload compatible files saved on a USB flash drive to the PlayStation Network, start by connecting the drive and going to **Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data on USB Storage Device.**
From here, select the files you want to transfer and click the Options button. Choose "Upload to Online Storage" and the PlayStation 4 will begin copying the selected data to your PSN cloud storage. You can then sign in on any console using the same PSN ID to access and download the uploaded files. This allows sharing game saves, themes and other settings across multiple PlayStation systems.
### **Downloading Transferred Files From PlayStation Network Storage**
After uploading compatible files to your PlayStation Network storage, retrieving them on another PlayStation 4 is simple. Sign in with the PSN account that was used to initially upload the files. Navigate to **Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data in Online Storage** and a list of your uploaded files will appear. 
Select the ones you want to download and click the Options button again. Choose "Download to System Storage" and the PlayStation 4 will retrieve the selected data from your PlayStation Network storage and save it locally. Now your game saves, themes and other settings can seamlessly roam between any PS4 consoles you sign into using that PSN profile.
### **Recommendations For Reliable File Transfers With PS4 and USB Drive**
To ensure smooth and trouble-free transfers between your PlayStation 4 and external USB flash drives, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
Only move file types that are officially supported by the PS4. While some lesser-known formats may appear to transfer, there is no guarantee they can be properly read later. Stick to compatible file extensions like .PNG, .JPG, .PDF and saved game data files. Also make sure to insert your USB drive correctly, wait for it to mount fully before transferring files, and carefully follow all on-screen instructions when copying or deleting files. 
It is further recommended that you sign in with the PlayStation Network account used to originally upload files. This ensures the transfer's referring metadata matches and files can be correctly downloaded. Eject USB drives safely using the option in the quick menu after each transfer as well. Formatting in exFAT or FAT32 may also help avoid issues. Adhering to these best practices will lead to smooth and reliable file sharing between PS4 and external storage drives.
### **Additional Tips For Maximizing USB Drive Usage**
While the core functionality of copying game saves and certain settings is straightforward, PlayStation 4 owners can leverage their USB drives in a few other convenient ways:
USB extended storage allows expanding the PS4's internal storage by formatting an external drive to work like an internal hard drive. This lets you install additional games and apps for easier access without swapping discs.
Media players like VLC also work on certain USB drives connected to PS4, enabling basic local video and audio playback that the system can't handle natively.
Community-created "save game editors" exist online for modding certain ports. While not endorsed by Sony, many work by transferring unmodified save files to and from a USB drive on Windows/Mac for editing.
Overall, with a little patience and care taken to follow best practices, USB flash drives are an essential tool for expanding functionality and managing game progression on the PlayStation 4 platform. Proper use helps maximize limited storage space and keep favorite games and progress readily accessible across multiple systems and platforms.
