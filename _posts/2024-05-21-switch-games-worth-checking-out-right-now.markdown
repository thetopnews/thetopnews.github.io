### Exploration Games for All Ages
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild redefined what an **open-world adventure game** could be on the Nintendo Switch. By stripping back conventions and focusing purely on player choice and environmental storytelling, Breath of the Wild created a virtual world that feels vibrantly alive. **With over 125 shrines, 900 Korok seeds and a constant sense of discovery around every corner**, players are kept entertained for hours on end as they explore Hyrule. Whether embarking on epic quests or simply taking in breathtaking vistas, Breath of the Wild sets the gold standard for games that place exploration front and center.

### Charming Islands to Unwind On  
Animal Crossing: New Horizons transported millions into a serene simulated world at the peak of worldwide lockdowns in 2020. As the resident representative of a deserted island, players work together with anthropomorphic animals to steadily transform their island getaway into a thriving community. From fishing and bug catching to designing infrastructure and decorating one's home, the gameplay loop of New Horizons is incredibly relaxing. With no deadlines or consequences for failure, the game creates a welcoming digital escape where players can unwind at their own pace. Its charming graphics and wholesome characters have broad, multi-generational appeal. For anyone seeking distraction or connection during turbulent times, New Horizons continues to joyfully occupy hours each day.
### Rollicking Roguelikes with Replayability 
Hades from Supergiant Games took the roguelike genre and infused it with a compelling story and top-notch gameplay. As Zagreus, the prince of the underworld, players must fight their way through ever-changing chambers, accumulating powerful boons from Olympian gods along the escape attempt. Superbly tuned action with various deadly weapons and abilities ensures repeated runs stay lively and exciting. What sets Hades apart, though, is how the narrative subtly evolves based on player choices and progress. Cutscenes unveil new layers to the richly-drawn cast of characters and their relationships. For both story and strategy fans craving longevity, Hades delivers countless runs of fun without repetition.
### Platforming Classics Optimized for Switch
The Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection bundles three pioneering 3D Mario adventures into one package. Super Mario 64 was a groundbreaking leap into polygonal platforming back in 1996. Super Mario Sunshine introduced variable nozzle tools on the GameCube. And the peerless Super Mario Galaxy expanded platforming into space across two Nintendo Wii installments. While emulation issues mean the games don't fully utilize the Switch's contemporary capabilities, they remain timeless showcases of level design mastery. For Mario fans new and old, reliving these genre-defining classics on the go is a nostalgic thrill, capturing the adventurous spirit that has endeared the plumber to generations. 
### Devious Waterfowl and their Shenanigans  
Untitled Goose Game captured the world with its simple yet brilliant premise - players control an mischievous goose let loose in a small town. The goal is to cause as much benign chaos and frustration for villagers as possible through stealthy manipulation of the environment. Whether stealing keys, disturbing picnics or distracting with honks, guiding the feathered fiend on its cunning exploits results in endless laughs. Developed by a small indie team, Untitled Goose Game demonstrates how creative constraints can spark innovative ideas. Despite its minimalist appearance, the game delivers richly detailed worlds that are a joy to disrupt goose-style for both young and old alike.
### Paper Mario's Clever Combat and Humor
The Paper Mario series uses the conceit of characters and environments literally made of paper or cardboard to clever innovative combat and puzzles. The latest entry, Paper Mario: The Origami King continues this tradition of merging the flat aesthetic with vibrant adventure. In combat, a target ring-based system encourages strategic ring placement to line up and defeat folded foes. Outside of battles, environmental puzzles require flexing origami skills. But it's the self-aware humor and charming characters that give Origami King its heart, telling an enjoyable story about perseverance against all odds. For fans of both Mario and creative RPGs, The Origami King delivers another worthy playthrough. 
### Social Deduction for Families 
Among Us blew up in popularity in 2020 with its cute visuals hiding a core concept of betrayal. In each game, players take on colorful astronaut avatars to complete tasks around a spaceship while one or more Impostors lurk, impersonating crewmates before secretly sabotaging and slaying others. When a body is discovered, surviving players must deduce "whodunit" through discussion of alibis, evidence and behavior in meetings. Its simplicity on the surface belies deep layers of psychology as trust is manipulated. On Nintendo Switch, the game provides families a safe way to experience those social dynamics together locally. Perfect for game nights at home with kids curious about deduction.
### Endless Mario Maker Community  
Super Mario Maker 2 builds upon the Wii U original by allowing players not just to play but also create their own custom Mario levels. An immense suite of tools and parts are on hand to let players flex their artistic skills across multiple Mario styles. The single-player story mode incorporates some co-op play too for added variety. But it's the endless stream of new maps from all over the world, of any difficulty and theme, that gives Mario Maker 2 its true endless longevity. Whether looking to hone platforming skills, gain design experience or just discover inventive creations, the Mario Maker community ensures surprise and inspiration around every corner.
### Competitive Pokémon Battles
Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield were the first main series Pokémon games developed for Nintendo Switch. While drawing some criticism for cutting content, the games succeeded at faithfully recreating the Pokémon experience on a home console. With beautifully stylized character models and environments representing the United Kingdom-inspired Galar region, Sword and Shield introduced new Pokémon forms and gameplay mechanics. At its core though remains the enjoyable monster-battling and adventuring that has entertained fans for over 20 years. For anyone wanting to catch, battle and trade Pokémon on the big screen with friends, Sword and Shield hit the mark as an accessible yet feature-filled entry point for Switch owners.
