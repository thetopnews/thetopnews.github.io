### Did You Know There's a Better Way Than Deleting Accounts? 
Genshin Impact allows players to connect their accounts to platforms like PlayStation Network (PSN) for cross-platform play. However, some players may wish to unlink these connections later on. In the past, deleting your PSN account was a common approach, but there is actually a better and safer method. 
This lengthy guide will walk through the full process for **properly unlinking your Genshin Impact account from PSN without needing to delete any profiles or lose game progress.** We'll explore why deletion is risky and unnecessary, how to request unlinking directly from miHoYo support, expected timeframes, and the key benefits of choosing this safer unlinking route.

### Avoid Losing Your Hard-Earned Progress and Purchases
Deleting your PSN account is a **drastic step that results in the permanent loss of all downloaded games, saves, trophies/achievements, and any digital content purchases** made through PlayStation. For Genshin Impact players who have spent countless hours building their characters and world, this would be extremely disappointing to lose. 
Thankfully, **miHoYo's customer support team can directly and safely unlink game accounts from specific platforms like PSN upon request.** This allows your Genshin save data and in-game purchases to be preserved while gaining flexibility to use alternate profiles if desired. It's the low-risk option worth exploring before considering the nuclear option of account deletion.
### Contact miHoYo Support Directly for Assistance
To begin the unlinking process, **open a support ticket by composing an email to genshin_cs@mihoyo.com**. Be sure to include **"PSN Account Unlink Request"** clearly in the subject line. Within the body, provide your in-game nickname, server, UID, and the email address registered to your PSN account. 
You will receive an **automated response confirming receipt** usually within one business day. Support will then manually review the request to **verify account ownership through additional security checks before approving the unlink.** This careful process protects players and prevents unauthorized changes to linked accounts.
### Expect the Unlink to Complete Within 1-2 Weeks
Once support validates your identity and request, the actual unlinking step on miHoYo's backend is very quick. However, total completion time is approximately **1-2 weeks after initial contact** due to the manual review period. This includes several business days for support's investigation followed by a few more for any system updates to fully unregister the connection. 
During this waiting stage, **you do not need to take any additional action** and can continue playing regularly between both accounts. An unlink confirmation email will arrive once fully dissociated. This clear communication and defined process ensures a smooth experience without unexpected downtime compared to the risky unknowns of deleting profiles independently.
### Keep Your Account Details Organized With a Notebook
With multiple platform logins and the extra security procedures of the unlink request, it can become easy to forget exact account details over time. To stay organized, consider **keeping all pertinent information together in a dedicated digital or physical notebook.**  
Include login credentials, server/region IDs, device UIDs for any connected platforms, purchase histories, and note the date ranges for important account events like unlink requests. Proper record keeping helps support quickly validate ownership later on if issues arise. It also brings peace of mind knowing this critical data is neatly stored for future reference should you need to reference it.
### Retain Access to Existing Friends and Guild Members  
For many players, part of what makes Genshin Impact so engaging is the ability to team up and socialize with others. Whether it is co-op bosses, random matchmaking, or dedicated clans/guilds - these community bonds would be disrupted if deleting accounts entirely.
By choosing the unlink route instead, your in-game nickname and friends list **remain fully intact across all platforms.** No need to rebuild connections or request re-adds. Guild leadership can also be smoothly transferred between PSN and alternate accounts hassle-free. The social pillars of your Genshin experience stay firmly in place through this process versus potential isolation after a full deletion.
### Your Genshin Journey Continues Seamlessly
Once complete, **log back into Genshin Impact with your chosen platform and username to resume normal play**. You will officially be disassociated from the prior linked PSN account with no further action required on your part. Your saved character data, inventory, quest progress - the full world you crafted - remains fully accessible thanks to the safe unlink approach.
Best of all, you retain adaptable account management going forward. Want to use separate profiles for certain events or multiplayer sessions? No problem - your account ownership and authorization were never jeopardized along the way either. The entire experience flows smoothly from start to finish when utilizing miHoYo's official support resources properly.
### In Summary: Consider Unlinking Over Deleting Accounts
For Genshin Impact players looking to adjust their platform connections later on, the unlink route is clearly superior to deleting either account independently through rash actions. By contacting miHoYo support upfront, sensitive personal information stays protected and years of hard work are preserved across all linked devices. 
Most importantly, the full community experience built within Genshin's vibrant player networks survives intact without missed connections or lonelier gameplay. With a little patience during the verification period, players retain full flexibility and control moving ahead versus potential account losses through deletion's risky permanence. Remember to stay organized too - keep notes on hand for smooth sailing now and in the future of your Teyvat travels!
