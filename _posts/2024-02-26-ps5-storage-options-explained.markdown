### Introduction
The **PlayStation 5 console** comes with 825GB of internal storage space, which **Sony balanced** to keep the system **affordable for players** while still providing some storage for gaming. However, there are a few options available to **expand PS5 storage capacity beyond the internal SSD**.

### What is the Internal SSD? 
The PS5's internal solid state drive (SSD) uses **PCIe Gen 4 technology** to offer extremely fast loading times optimized for games developed for the new console. This SSD allows things like assets and textures to stream seamlessly for a **smooth gameplay experience**. However, the 825GB capacity is really only enough to have **5 to 10 modern games installed** at a given time depending on the game file sizes, so expansion is necessary for serious gamers.
### Using External USB Storage 
Players can hook up external USB hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid state drives (SSDs) to store their PS5 game library and free up space on the internal SSD. While games cannot be played directly from USB storage, titles can be transferred back to internal storage as needed for playing. This allows keeping a large **game library collection accessible** without access storage space limitations. 
### The M.2 SSD Expansion Slot 
Sony wisely included an M.2 SSD expansion slot that will enable players to directly add even more high-speed solid state storage. In the future, **Sony will provide a list of NVMes certified** to meet the performance needs for PS5 gaming. These superspeed drives will deliver similar speeds to the internal SSD. However, thus far very few such drives actually exist, so this option is not very feasible right after launch.
### Weighing Console Costs and Storage Size
When determining the PS5's internal storage size and system price, Sony had to carefully balance **keeping production costs low** to reach a reasonable price point while including sufficient space for PS5 gameplay. Doubling the storage to 1.5TB or higher would have significantly increased manufacturing costs, pricing out many potential customers from the new platform.
### Research Informed Sony's Decisions
Market research on PS4 usage trends helped Sony understand that most players typically only have **5 to 10 current-generation games installed** at a time. File sizes are also growing for new titles, but not exponentially. Based on this, the 825GB SSD is large enough for the everyday player without hiking up a premium price tag that could discourage adoption of the new system. 
### Summary
In summary, while 825GB may seem small, Sony's market data showed this amount met average gamers' installed game needs out of the box. And the expandability via USB drives or future M.2 SSDs means storage can grow over the console lifetime too. Sony aimed to strike a balance that made PS5 accessible to all players interested in next-gen gaming.
