### A Life in Bondage
**John was born into slavery** on a large cotton plantation in rural Mississippi in the 1830s. From a young age, he endured backbreaking labor in the fields under a scorching sun. The overseers showed no mercy, doling out brutal whippings for even the smallest mistakes or acts of disobedience. When John was just 10 years old, he was **devastated** when his mother and sister were sold away to another plantation, never to be seen again. For the next two decades, John knew only hardship as a field slave, longing for freedom but without hope of ever attaining it.

### Discovery of the Brotherhood 
One hot August night, John's overseer took his whip to an elderly slave who had collapsed from exhaustion. In a rage, John attacked the overseer, swiftly strangling the man to death to end his abuse once and for all. Knowing he would be hanged for murder, John fled into the swamps. Lost and desperate, he was found by an Assassin named Thomas, who saw John's spirit and fighting ability. Thomas revealed to John about the Assassin Brotherhood, a secret order devoted to destroying the Templars who profited tremendously from the slave trade. John eagerly pledged himself to the Brotherhood, seeing in them a means to finally strike back against the system that had tortured him his whole life.
### Establishing Escape Routes
Working closely with Thomas and other Assassins, both former slaves and free black allies, John helped establish an elaborate network of safe houses and guides across the Deep South to aid in the escape of runaways. Utilizing stealth, sabotage, and subterfuge, John undermined bounty hunters, disrupted slave auctions, and destroyed ledgers and property records to hamper the recapture of fleeing slaves. Through his efforts, scores of slaves were able to break their chains and flee to the North. Word of the Assassins' crusade began to spread, instilling hope in those still trapped on the plantations. 
### Reuniting with Family
For years, John tirelessly worked to dismantle the slave trade as an Assassin. But he never stopped thinking of his mother and sister, sold away so long ago. Receiving intelligence that his sister Sarah was being held on a plantation in rural Georgia, John infiltrated the property under cover of a fierce thunderstorm. After a perilous search evading patrollers, John finally found Sarah toiling in the fields. That night, with stealth and precision, John and Sarah eliminated the overseers, reuniting at long last. After so many years apart, the siblings tearfully embraced, overjoyed at their reunion but knowing their mission was not yet complete.
### Conducting Freedom's Call 
John and Sarah became leading conductors on the Underground Railroad, risking their lives monthly to guide dozens of slaves to freedom. Utilizing passwords, safe houses, disguises, and clever deceptions, they led groups northward under shroud of darkness. Whether on foot or by wagon, John and Sarah evaded bounty hunters, patrols, and hired men pursuing substantial rewards for runaways. Reaching states like Tennessee, Indiana and Ohio, they connected fugitives to other conductors, seeing many to final sanctuary in the North. Through the Assassins' efforts and those of allies like the Rankins, hundreds escaped the tyranny of bondage, revitalizing the march towards liberty.
### Rising Conflict with Slavers
As more slaves found courage to revolt or flee bondage with the Assassins' aid, the vast power and influence of plantation owners began to slip. Wealthy families like the Davenport and Crenshaw formed paramilitary groups to hunt down the "terrorists" threatening their lucrative industry. John soon found himself in lethal clashes with these bounty hunters and militias. In a dramatic confrontation, John engaged the notorious slaving family Rankin, who had captured and tormented runaways for decades. After a brutal battle, John emerged victorious, eliminating one of the greatest obstacles to the freedom of thousands. Word of his exploits spread terror in the slave owning class.
