Splatoon 2 is one of the most popular multiplayer shooters on the Nintendo Switch, with millions of players competing online every day. However, some key aspects of the full experience require paying for Nintendo Switch Online (NSO). Let's break down what you need to know about Splatoon 2's online requirements and whether Nintendo Switch Online is worth it for new players.
### **Splatoon 2's Deep Single-Player Campaign**
The game includes a robust single-player story mode called "Hero Mode" that provides 10-15 hours of gameplay on its own. This mode takes players through various levels battling against AI enemies and bosses. **You can play through the entire Hero Mode campaign completely offline without needing an NSO subscription.** For those looking for a meaty single-player shooter experience, Splatoon 2 delivers even without online access.

### **Limited Online Access Without Paying** 
While Splatoon 2 does allow limited online functionality without NSO, you cannot access the heart of the online multiplayer. Players without a subscription can only access the lobby area and Equip screens to customize their character's gear. **They are blocked from participating in any of the core online multiplayer modes like Turf War, Ranked Battle, or Salmon Run.** This severely limits the amount of content available to play for those not paying for NSO.
### **The Competitive Heart of Splatoon 2 Requires NSO**
"Turf War" is the standard 4v4 team-based multiplayer mode where the goal is to cover the most ground on the map in ink. It's the bread and butter online experience that most players enjoy. "Ranked Battles" offer more structured competitive play with matchmaking and visible skill rankings. "Salmon Run" is a cooperative wave defense mode played against waves of CPU salmonid enemies. All three of these wildly popular modes that represent the true heart of Splatoon 2's multiplayer components require an active NSO subscription to access.
### **Additional Single-Player Content Remains Accessible**  
For those interested in squeezing more out of the single-player experience, the "Octo Expansion" paid story DLC provides many additional hours of gameplay. This campaign takes place after the main story and features missions, levels, and bosses with greater challenges than the base game. Unlike online multiplayer, **the Octo Expansion can still be played even without an NSO membership.** While it costs extra up front, it provides valuable extra content for offline players.
### **Is the Single-Player Enough Without Online?**
While the Hero Mode campaign and Octo Expansion offer a robust single-player experience amounting to 20-25 hours together, the gameplay does have limited replay value once completed. Much of Splatoon 2's long-term engagement comes from competing online and improving one's skills against other human players. So for those seeking multiplayer competition long-term, the value lies in paying for NSO access. However, the substantial offline content means it can still provide entertainment as a primarily single-player experience alone if needed.
### **Consider Refund Options Before Committing to NSO** 
If you purchase Splatoon 2 solely for its online play but are unsure about committing to an NSO subscription long-term, check the game retailer's return policy. Many stores allow returning unopened games within a certain window for a full refund. This allows testing out the online components risk-free before fully investing. Another option is to see if the robust single-player alone provides perceived value for the retail cost, even without multiplayer access down the line. There are paths to getting your money's worth without NSO if the commitment seems iffy.
### **Splatoon 2 Offers a Full Gaming Experience - But Only With NSO**  
While players can experience the story campaigns offline without NSO, **Splatoon 2 truly shines as one of the best competitive online shooters available**. The core multiplayer modes of Turf War, Ranked Battle and Salmon Run represent where most of the depth and replay value lies for fans. Only by paying for the Nintendo Switch Online membership can you access the full breadth of what makes Splatoon 2 such an addictive experience with a vibrant community. So for those looking to fully immerse themselves in all that Splatoon 2 has to offer long-term, budgeting for the cost of NSO is a must.
In summary, Nintendo's Splatoon 2 provides a robust single-player campaign that can be enjoyed independently of online subscriptions. However, access to the game's most popular modes, deepest competitive play, and fullest community experience requires paying for Nintendo Switch Online. New players would be wise to understand Splatoon 2's online requirements upfront to properly manage their expectations of the full value. Overall, it remains one of the most critically acclaimed multiplayer shooters on the Nintendo Switch - though only NSO can unlock its true potential online.
