Brunei is a small, peaceful nation located on the north coast of the island of Borneo. While it may not offer a lively party scene or wild nightlife, Brunei has its own charms that attract both locals and foreigners to call it home. In this article, we delve into perspectives from Bruneians and expats to understand what living in Brunei is truly like.
#### A Place of Peace and Relaxation 
Many expats appreciate Brunei for its quiet, relaxed pace of life. The locals describe daily life as "mundane and boring" unless one expects luxury on par with the royal family. However, the lack of **hectic urban bustle** provides respite for those seeking peace, quiet, and stress-free living. 
Medical care and education are **subsidized heavily** for citizens. And while job opportunities favor locals, expats can find employment, especially as teachers at prestigious private schools for a comfortable salary.

#### Conservative Values and Homophobia
Brunei follows a conservative interpretation of Sharia law. **LGBTQ rights and freedoms** are restricted, with homosexuality technically illegal. However, according to a queer local, direct homophobia and bullying are rare; people avoid or ignore LGBTQ individuals instead. While acceptance remains elusive, overt discrimination is also uncommon.
#### Affordability and Amenities 
Cost of living is low for both locals and expats. Monthly utilities rarely exceed $7 for citizens due to government **subsidies on resources**. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment runs about $100. Food is abundant and halal. Cinemas and malls offer everyday amenities at affordable prices. 
#### Economic Challenges for Locals
However, not all locals perceive Brunei as financially stable. While oil and gas wealth exist, most funding goes to the royal family rather than citizens. Jobs remain difficult to secure without qualifications. Salaries also tend to be low compared to developed nations. **Wealth inequality** colors the economic picture.  
#### Housing Realities  
Contrary to claims of cheap public housing, long waits (10-20 years) exist for subsidized units, which are unavailable to all. Private market housing costs are high. Most locals opt to purchase their own homes if financially able due to better quality than renting. A true **$100 monthly apartment** does not exist in Brunei.
#### Tourism and Regional Connectivity
From an expat view, Brunei benefits from proximity to other destinations. Flights to neighboring Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore are frequent and affordable. The small, quiet capital offers a relaxing contrast to these vibrant places. Tourists can easily visit Brunei as a stop on trips around **Borneo and Southeast Asia**.
#### Life in Brunei: Diverse Realities
Overall, perspectives on living in Brunei vary widely based on socioeconomic class and nationality. While peace, affordability and community attract many, lack of opportunities, conservative values, and economic challenges remain issues. Both pros and cons co-exist in this tiny, complex nation with a diversity of lived realities.
