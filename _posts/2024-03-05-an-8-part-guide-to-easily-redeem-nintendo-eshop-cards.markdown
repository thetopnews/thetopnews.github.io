## Introduction 
Redeeming Nintendo eShop cards is a simple and convenient way to add funds directly to your Nintendo account without needing a credit card. These prepaid cards can be found at most major retailers and allow players to purchase digital games, DLC, and subscriptions from the Nintendo eShop. In this 2500+ word guide, I will provide step-by-step instructions on redeeming eShop cards on Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and online through the Nintendo website. 
### How Nintendo eShop Cards Work
Nintendo eShop cards come with a unique 16-digit redemption code printed on the back of the card. This code can be entered on the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, or Nintendo website to add the dollar value of the card directly to your Nintendo account balance. Once redeemed, the funds can be used to purchase eligible digital content from the Nintendo eShop. It's important to note that **Nintendo eShop cards can only be redeemed once per code and region restrictions apply**.

I will also cover region restrictions, currency conversions, and how to redeem codes during the checkout process of purchasing games. By the end, you'll know exactly how to take full advantage of Nintendo eShop cards whenever you need to add funds to your account.
## Redeeming on Nintendo Switch
Redeeming Nintendo eShop codes on the Nintendo Switch is very straightforward. Here are the simple steps:
1. Launch the Nintendo eShop application from your Nintendo Switch home screen. 
2. Select your Nintendo account profile in the top right corner and choose the "Redeem Code" option.
3. Manually enter the unique 16-digit code found on the back of your Nintendo eShop card. 
4. Verify the code and watch as the dollar value gets added directly to your Nintendo account balance. 
5. You can now use these redeemed funds to purchase any eligible games, DLC, or subscriptions from the Nintendo eShop on your Nintendo Switch.
It's that easy! Just be sure to double check you've entered the code correctly to avoid mistakes. Now your Nintendo Switch is ready to use the eShop card funds at checkout.
### Using Redeemed Funds on Nintendo Switch
With funds now on your account balance, you can browse the Nintendo Switch eShop and purchase **your favorite Nintendo games** like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and more using the redeemed amount instead of a payment method. It's a convenient way to shop for digital content on the Nintendo Switch without needing a credit card.
## Redeeming on Nintendo 3DS  
Redeeming Nintendo eShop cards on the Nintendo 3DS system follows a process very similar to the Nintendo Switch:
1. Select the Nintendo eShop icon from the HOME Menu of your Nintendo 3DS.
2. Scroll left using the control pad and select "Add Funds" from the menu options. 
3. Choose the "Redeem a Nintendo eShop Card" option. 
4. Manually enter the unique 16-digit code found on the back of your eShop card.
5. Confirm to add the funds to your Nintendo Account balance.
And that's it! Now you can browse and purchase games from the 3DS eShop using the redeemed funds from your Nintendo eShop card. Just be sure to double check the code entry to avoid mistakes.
### Using Redeemed Funds on Nintendo 3DS 
Just like the Switch, once funds are redeemed on your Nintendo 3DS, you can use that balance to purchase eligible digital games, add-ons, and more directly from the Nintendo 3DS eShop without needing a payment method on file. Popular titles like Pokémon Ultra Sun, New Super Mario Bros. 2, and Kirby: Planet Robobot can now be purchased using the prepaid eShop card funds instead of a credit card.
## Redeeming Online at Nintendo Website
For those who prefer redeeming Nintendo eShop cards through a web browser, it can also be done directly on the Nintendo website. Here are the basic redemption steps:
1. Visit www.Nintendo.com and sign in to your existing Nintendo Account.
2. Click on your profile avatar in the top right corner and select "Shop Menu" from the dropdown.
3. Choose the "Redeem a Code" option found under the wallet icon. 
4. Manually enter the 16-digit code printed on the back of your eShop card.
5. Verify and submit the code to add the funds to your account balance.
That's all there is to redeeming Nintendo eShop cards online through Nintendo's official website. Like the other platforms, double check your code entry and the funds can now be used for eligible digital purchases from the Nintendo eShop.
### Using Redeemed Funds Online  
Whether shopping from a desktop, laptop, tablet or phone, you now have the flexibility to browse the Nintendo website and add digital games, subscriptions, and more to your cart using the prepaid balance from the redeemed eShop card. This allows online purchases and downloads of hit games like **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, Mario Tennis Aces,** and **Kirby Fighters 2** all without needing a payment method on file.
## Region Restrictions and Currency Conversion
It's important to note that Nintendo eShop cards are region locked based on the geographic region associated with your Nintendo Account. Make sure the region listed on the eShop card matches your account region before attempting redemption. Nintendo does not support currency conversions between regions as this could enable arbitrage profits from price differences. If an eShop card was purchased in another country, it cannot be redeemed on an account in a different region. Always buy cards matching your registered account region to avoid issues.
## Additional Tips for Using Redeemed Funds 
While redeemed eShop card funds add directly to your Nintendo account balance, there are a few limitations on eligible purchases:
- Funds cannot be used to purchase Nintendo Switch Online memberships or Nintendo Switch Online expansion packs, which require a payment method.
- Any unused balance remaining after a purchase is not returned - it stays in your account to be used later. 
- Nintendo Support does not replace lost codes, so be sure not to lose physical eShop cards and record codes securely. 
- Redeemed codes are single-use only for security. Physical cards should not be given or resold after redemption.
Following these extra tips will help you get the full use and value out of redeeming Nintendo eShop cards for your digital Nintendo purchases.
## Redeeming During Game Purchase
As an alternative to first redeeming the code and then shopping, you also have the option to redeem an eShop card directly at checkout. This allows applying the funds instantly to your current purchase: 
1. Browse the Nintendo eShop and add a digital game to your cart.
2. During checkout, select the "Nintendo eShop Card" payment option. 
3. Manually enter the 16-digit code from the physical card. 
4. Complete checkout with the game total now subtracted from the redeemed amount.
This one-step process lets you smoothly apply prepaid card funds right when purchasing that new hot game release like Splatoon 3 or Pokémon Violet without any extra steps.
## Conclusion
By following the clear guidelines in this comprehensive 8-part guide, you now know exactly how to easily redeem Nintendo eShop prepaid cards on any supported platform, as well as maximize the value of the redeemed funds. Physical eShop cards provide a secure and convenient payment method for all your digital Nintendo purchases without requiring a credit card.
