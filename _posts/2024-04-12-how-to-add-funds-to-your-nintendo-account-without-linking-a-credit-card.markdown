## Part 1 - Introduction
Nintendo recently started requiring players to link a credit card when adding funds directly to their account. However, there are still alternative payment options available for funding your Nintendo account without having to provide your credit card details. In this article, we will explore **six easy methods** for adding money to enjoy digital Nintendo games, apps, and content on the eShop without the need to link a payment card.
## Part 2 - Purchase Nintendo eShop Gift Cards 
### Redeem Physical or Digital Gift Cards
One of the most popular options is purchasing **Nintendo eShop gift cards from major retailers**. These prepaid cards are available in denominations from $10 to $50 and can easily be redeemed on the Nintendo account. Whether you buy physical cards in stores or receive digital codes online, simply enter the long redemption code during the "Add Funds" process. Once credited, the balance acts just like cash in your digital wallet to spend on games, downloads, and in-game purchases from the Nintendo eShop. Stocking up on gift cards during sales allows budgeting funds conveniently without sharing private financial details.

## Part 3 - Add Funds with PayPal
### A Secure Alternative Payment Gateway  
For those with a PayPal account, it offers a convenient cash-like option for adding money to your Nintendo balance. During checkout in the Nintendo eShop, select "PayPal" as the payment method and login with your PayPal credentials. Enter the amount to transfer and complete the transaction through PayPal's secured interface. Funds are then immediately available on your Nintendo profile without needing to link a bank account or debit/credit card to Nintendo directly. For **extra security and privacy**, PayPal is a great alternative payment provider.
## Part 4 - Purchase Physical Games and Codes
### Spend Wisely on Tangible Media
Rather than only downloading digital games, physical cartridges or codes for Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and other systems can also be purchased from various retailers. Most major stores sell first-party Nintendo games as physical game cards and cases that do not require any eShop balance. Additionally, some bundles include download codes for full games or DLC packaged with the product. By spending strategically on physical media and codes included, it allows enjoying new releases without needing available funds linked directly to your Nintendo profile.
## Part 5 - Subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online 
### Access Online Play for Less
A Nintendo Switch Online individual or family membership provides online multiplayer access and exclusive offers an affordable price. For just $20 per year, Switch Online adds valuable functionality and value to the Nintendo gaming experience. Rather than a one-time purchase, the membership renews automatically each year as a recurring payment. Best of all, the service comes bundled with a growing selection of NES and SNES classic games perfect for **retro gaming on the go**. The built-in library helps offset the demand for constantly purchasing new digital games and DLC from the eShop.
## Part 6 - Use Digital Funds Wisely
### Stretch Your Existing Balance
If some credits are already tied to your Nintendo account from gifts or previous purchases, it's important to spend prudently. Any remaining balances on Nintendo eShop gift cards will automatically roll over for future use. You can also earn My Nintendo gold points from eligible digital games and hardware to gain small discounts on new releases. Carefully budgeting already available funds and coupons can go a long way if extra money can't be added at the moment. It's also worth exploring free-to-start options or game demos that don't require any upfront costs on the eShop. With smart spending habits, digital credits can last longer without needing to add more right away.
