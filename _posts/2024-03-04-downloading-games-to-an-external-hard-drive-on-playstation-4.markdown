## Storing PlayStation 4 Game Saves And Downloads Across Multiple Systems Using Extended Storage
### Saving Game Progress Between PlayStation 4s
Game save data is important to preserve your progress when switching between PlayStation 4 consoles. The PlayStation 4 allows saving game saves directly to an external hard drive, making it easy to transfer that save data. **PlayStation cloud saves** provide another option but require an internet connection to access from another system. Game saves are tied specifically to the PSN account used to purchase or launch the associated game.

### Restrictions on Sharing Digital Game Licenses
While physically owning a game disc allows playing the game on any PlayStation 4, digital game downloads are typically licensed to the PSN account that purchased them. To play a digitally downloaded title on another PlayStation 4, the original PSN account must be signed in and manually authorize that console. This prevents one digital purchase from being freely shared on multiple systems simultaneously. **game sharing limitations** help ensure publishers and developers receive proper compensation for each copy played.
### Formatting Extended Storage for Game Installs 
Only PlayStation 4 systems running system software version 4.50 or higher currently support extending storage with an external hard drive. The external drive must use the USB 3.0 interface for best performance and have a minimum recommended capacity of 250GB. When formatting the external drive, it will erase any existing data so be sure to back up anything important elsewhere first using alternative storage.
### Configuring Download Location Settings
Within the PlayStation 4's system storage settings, the application install location can be set to the extended external hard drive. Navigating to Settings then Storage allows selecting the extended storage as the default download location for all future game installations. This ensures new games download directly to the additional external space rather than using limited internal storage. 
### Alternative Storage Methods Not Recommended  
While some explore burning downloaded games to disc or modifying console firmware, these are generally not advisable options. Both Sony and Microsoft ban systems using altered firmware from their networks, removing online access. Publishers also disallow distributing copies not purchased, so these workarounds often violate terms of use. Overall **expanded storage solutions** from the manufacturer are safest and simplest approaches. 
### Benefits of Expanded Console Storage 
Adding an external hard drive extends the storage capacity of the PlayStation 4 significantly. This frees up internal space for more game installations without redownloading entire titles. Game saves no longer rely on an internet connection for cloud access and can seamlessly move between systems. With the added capacity of **USB 3.0 external hard drives**, a major limitation of the PlayStation 4's storage is effectively removed.
### Considerations When Using Expanded Storage
A few things to keep in mind regarding expanded console storage. The external drive must stay connected for games installed there to be playable. Transfer speeds may potentially be slower than the internal drive depending on specific USB interface speeds. And formatting will erase any non-game data, so proper backups are important. Overall the flexibility outweighs these minor considerations.
### Conclusion 
In summary, connecting an external USB hard drive to the PlayStation 4 allows seamlessly transferring games, saves, and downloads between consoles while signed into the owning PSN account. This expanded storage solution resolves frustrations of the PlayStation 4's limited base storage. Game libraries can grow almost infinitely while preserving progress across systems for an optimized experience. External hard drives are inexpensive and simply expand what was once a restrictive element of console ownership.
