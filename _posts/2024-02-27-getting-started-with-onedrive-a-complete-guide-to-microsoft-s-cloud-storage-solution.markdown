### Part 1 - Signing Up and Accessing Your 5GB of Free Storage
Getting started with OneDrive is simple. Just head to OneDrive.com and click the "Sign in" button. You'll have the option to sign in with an existing Microsoft account or create a new one. **Creating a new Microsoft account only takes a few minutes**, and you'll immediately get 5GB of free cloud storage included. 
Once logged in, you'll land on your OneDrive homepage. Here you'll see your files and folders and have quick access to upload, share, and download content. **The intuitive dashboard makes it easy to organize and access all your cloud-stored files from any device.** Getting acquainted with the OneDrive interface won't take long, and soon you'll be leveraging the cloud to access your documents, photos, and videos from anywhere.

### Part 2 - Uploading Files, Photos, and Videos from Any Device  
One of the best parts about OneDrive is how effortlessly you can add content from all your devices. Whether you're at your computer, tablet, or phone, uploading files to OneDrive is simple. On Windows, you can right-click a file or folder and select "Save to OneDrive" to sync it. Mac users can drag and drop directly to their OneDrive folder. 
For mobile, you can either select files directly from your device's storage in the OneDrive app or upload pictures straight from your camera roll. Large uploads are seamlessly resumed if interrupted by low signal or battery life. What's more, OneDrive optimizes photos for the web, so you can freely share full-quality images without hogging up recipients' inboxes.
### Part 3 - Accessing and Editing Office Files from Any Device  
In addition to file storage, a OneDrive subscription unlocks the power of Microsoft Office online. This web-based office suite includes lightweight versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more for **basic document editing directly in your browser.** Whether composing a memo on your phone or collaborating on a presentation abroad, Office Online lets you work seamlessly across devices.
Files stay up-to-date thanks to real-time syncing with OneDrive. Any changes made on one device automatically sync to others, so you never lose your work or end up with multiple conflicting versions. And with support for common Office file types, you can open and edit documents shared via email, Dropbox, or other services directly in your browser.
### Part 4 - Purchasing Additional Storage and Sharing Files Securely
While the initial 5GB of space may satisfy light users, heavy cloud users will want to upgrade their OneDrive storage. Thankfully, Microsoft offers **affordable monthly or annual plans** with prices starting as low as $1.99/month for 50GB and $6.99/month for 1TB. Upgrades can be easily managed directly in your OneDrive account settings. 
Additional storage allows hoarding more of your photos, videos, and documents in the cloud. And with the option to share files externally, that capacity becomes even more flexible. OneDrive generates link-protected URLs that let you share individual files, folders, or even entire cameras' photo libraries with anyone, no matter if they have their own OneDrive account or not. Granular sharing settings let you control who can view or edit shared content for worry-free collaboration.
### Part 5 - Accessing Your Files from Practically Any Device 
OneDrive truly lets you access all your important files on virtually any device. Whether you're on a laptop, desktop, tablet or phone, your cloud files are always within reach through the web portal or dedicated mobile apps. The OneDrive web app behaves like any other cloud storage option, but signing in opens a familiar folder view of all your content. Files can be downloaded, shared, or edited online as needed.
Mobile apps bring that same experience seamlessly to Android and iOS. Automatically synced folders keep local versions of your most recently accessed files available offline too. And deep platform integrations on Windows 10 and macOS Finder let OneDrive files feel just as accessible as local folders right from your primary operating systems. This comprehensive device coverage ensures you're never far from your cloud-stored content no matter where work or life takes you.
### Part 6 - Organizing and Sharing Your Photo Library in the Cloud  
Beyond document storage, OneDrive provides an integrated solution for keeping your photo archive organized and accessible online as well. Photos are automatically uploaded at their original sizes and resolutions for high quality sharing. And behind the scenes, OneDrive utilizes each image's embedded location and date data to group shots together intuitively by time and place.
Skim through your entire catalog or drill down into albums of weddings, vacations, and beyond straight from your browser. A simple sharing panel makes it effortless to generate one-time links or public sharing addresses for distributing your media. Even better, create shared photo albums to give specific contacts ongoing access to specific moments like your kid's sports games or pets' antics. Avoid clogging inboxes and enjoy viewing media across any device.
### Part 7 - Version History and File Syncing Across Devices  
For the utmost peace of mind, OneDrive monitors all your file changes and stores previous versions of documents, spreadsheets, images and more for 30 days. With a single click, you can restore files back to any of their previous states directly from your OneDrive, covering edits both local and cloud-based. 
Complementing version history is OneDrive's deep file synchronization. Keep local copies of your top files synced across computers and phones while freeing up local storage. When changes are made, like editing a Office file on your desktop, syncing happens seamlessly in the background to update files across all your signed-in devices. Conflicting edits are automatically resolved to ensure everyone's working off the same content.
### Part 8 - Robust Security, Privacy, and Around-the-Clock Support    
As you store more of your private data in the cloud with OneDrive, security naturally becomes a top concern. Thankfully, OneDrive employs bank-level encryption for all files both at rest and in transit. And enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra barrier against unauthorized access beyond your password alone.
Granular sharing settings allow you to control exactly who sees what down to the file and folder level too. For instance, give certain contacts view-only access to parts of your OneDrive while permitting full editing rights to close collaborators. 
Peace of mind also comes from Microsoft's around-the-clock live chat, phone, and online self-help support for any OneDrive issues. And an active online user community provides another outlet for getting questions answered by fellow users.
