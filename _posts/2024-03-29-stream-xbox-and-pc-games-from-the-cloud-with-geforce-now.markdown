GeForce Now is NVIDIA's cloud gaming service that allows users to stream high-quality games to a wide range of devices. By leveraging NVIDIA's powerful gaming hardware in the cloud, GeForce Now delivers an incredible gaming experience that is accessible from almost anywhere. Here is a closer look at GeForce Now and what it has to offer gamers.
### Access Your Existing Game Libraries
GeForce Now gives members access to the PC game libraries they've built up on popular digital storefronts like **Steam, Epic Games Store**, and **Ubisoft Connect**. With over **1,000 supported games** currently available, GeForce Now allows users to play titles they already own without needing high-end gaming PCs. Some of the biggest games like **Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite,** and **Control** are all supported. Publishers are consistently adding more titles to the service as well.

### Hardware Requirements Are Minimal
To take advantage of GeForce Now, users will need a minimum internet speed of around **25 Mbps download**. The service is accessible on a wide range of devices including Windows and Mac computers, Android phones and tablets, Chromebooks, NVIDIA's Shield TV, and even iOS devices through their web apps. This makes GeForce Now extremely accessible regardless of what types of devices someone owns. As long as a stable internet connection is available, GeForce Now can deliver great streaming quality.
### Streaming Quality and Latency Optimized
With an internet speed of around 50 Mbps or higher, GeForce Now is capable of streaming games at up to 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second for buttery smooth visuals. NVIDIA has done extensive work to optimize the service for minimal latency as well. Positive user reviews have praised GeForce Now for its ability to deliver an experience that feels very close to native PC or console gaming. Quality and responsiveness can vary somewhat depending on an individual's connection, but generally GeForce Now performs quite well.
### Membership Options for All Budgets
GeForce Now is available both for free and through various paid membership plans. The free membership allows for hour-long gaming sessions. The priority membership runs $9.99 per month and extends session time limits while providing RTX graphics capabilities and priority access. For the ultimate experience, the RTX 3080 membership provides the full power of NVIDIA's top-end hardware, support for 1440p resolution at 120 FPS, and longer eight-hour sessions for $99.99 per quarter. There are affordable options as well as plans for more serious gamers. 
### A Wide Range of Supported Games
With access to library games from top PC stores, GeForce Now already supports over 1,000 different titles. The service continues growing its library through new partnerships with publishers. Some of the most popular supported games currently include free-to-play hits like Fortnite and Apex Legends, AAA blockbusters such as Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and a wide variety of indie games. Services like Steam allow for discovering many new supported games as well. NVIDIA works hard to add support for additional game publishers.
### The Future is Bright for Cloud Gaming
As internet speeds and streaming technologies continue to advance rapidly, cloud gaming services like GeForce Now are poised to significantly widen the reach of high-end PC and console-quality games. 5G networks and faster home internet will allow for even better streaming quality and lower latency in the years ahead. If NVIDIA maintains relationships with top publishers and PC services, GeForce Now's library could continue expanding rapidly. With competitive pricing tiers available, GeForce Now looks set to play a starring role in the growth of game streaming going forward. Gamers everywhere stand to benefit from ubiquitous access to top-tier games through services like NVIDIA's GeForce Now.
