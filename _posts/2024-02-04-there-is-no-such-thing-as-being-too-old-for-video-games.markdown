### Gaming is Enjoyed by People of All Ages
Games have become a favorite pastime for people from young to old. **Adult gamers in their late 30s and 40s** are now commonly found enjoying the latest gaming titles on various platforms like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation and PC. In fact, the average age of gamers today is around **37 years old according to recent surveys**. Much like books and movies which entertain audiences of varying demographics, games provide enjoyment that spans all generations. As long as one can afford gaming hardware and has spare time, they should feel free to play any games that interest them without concern over age restrictions.
Some may argue that games are designed primarily for children and teenagers. However, the large population of adult gamers proves that gaming appeals to most age groups. Many popular franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Mario, Pokémon and others have multi-generational fan bases comprised of players from their original youthful audiences as well as a new generation discovering these beloved series. Just as an older individual may re-read their favorite book from childhood for nostalgia, adult gamers revisit classic titles that provide feelings of comfort and joy.

### Mature Titles Attract Adult Audiences
A portion of the gaming landscape caters especially to adult interests with **titles rated “M for Mature”** that feature more realistic violence, language or sensitive subject matter. These story-driven experiences can touch on complex topics that may not be age-appropriate for younger players. Titles in the Yakuza, Resident Evil, The Witcher and Grand Theft Auto franchises offer mature narratives focusing on issues like organized crime, political corruption or moral dilemmas. While not intended for all audiences, these games find success with older demographics seeking deeper gameplay. 
### Bias Against Certain Platforms Lacks Justification
Unfortunately, bias persists in believing that gaming should end at a certain age. This type of prejudice unfairly maligns players of all ages. Hardware like the Nintendo 3DS withstand this bias despite appealing to both children and adults with its catalog of classic Nintendo franchises as well as independent titles. With its affordable price and portable handheld design, the 3DS remains a popular system for experienced gamers to play on the go or at home. Comments implying that an “adult should not want” a 3DS due to its child-friendly image promote ageist attitudes without cause. All systems deserve equal respect depending on the preferences of each individual player.
### Give the Gamer the System They Desire Most 
When gifting a game-related present, the wishes of the recipient should take highest priority. A thoughtful gift reflects interest in their specific interests rather than assumptions. If a child mentions aspiring to own the latest Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 5 to play with friends online, getting them a less capable system could undermine the gift. While second-hand or lesser consoles may seem like a budget-friendly option, they risk disappointment if not what the child envisioned. Gamers usually have clear favoritesthey would enjoy for years, making any substitutes unsatisfactory. The pleasure of the gift lies in fulfilling their stated desires rather than what the giver independently thinks is suitable.
### Pre-Owned Options May Prove a Stopgap 
For situations where financial limitations cannot accommodate a new top-of-the-line system, a previously-enjoyed lower-cost alternative could serve as a stopgap gift. Pre-owned Nintendo 3DS systems, in particular, offer deep game libraries at more budget-friendly price points than current gen consoles. While obviously not presenting the latest features, a well-kept used 3DS allows access to great games while patiently saving further for their true console of choice. This intermediate step demonstrates consideration for the gamer's interest without unrealistic expense. However, the older system would ideally act as a placeholder until upgrading to their desired Xbox, PlayStation or Switch in the future.
### Respect a Child's Growing Knowledge of their Passions
By age 10, children develop relationships and begin to understand their own unique tastes. Through conversations with peers, they learn about popular gaming trends. Dismissing a stated system preference shows disregard for a tween's expanding interests and self-awareness. Many gamers can articulate detailed arguments for their console preferences by this age. Assuming a young person wouldn't appreciate or understand a gift betrays their intelligent perspective and risks damaging the bond of trust in the relationship. Displaying belief in a child's expanding intellect fosters positive self-esteem and connection between family members.
### Patience Yields Greater Reward Than Settling 
For gifters with genuine inability to procure the requested system, maintaining open communication and patience often leads to richer outcomes than rushed inadequate substitutes. Frank discussions help build understanding for both parties. The gift-giver can explain budgetary realities while reassured the desires have not changed. This approach promotes honesty and prevents waste on unsatisfying placeholders. With perseverance and shared goal-setting, working together toward the dream system allows forming lasting joyous memories upon achievement rather than lingering "what-ifs" that diminish a gift's potential impact. In time, attaining the initially longed-for console through cooperation and delayed gratification nurtures stronger familial bonds.
### Prioritizing the Individual's Valid Preferences
Above all else when considering gifts for any gamer, respecting their unique viewpoints matters most. Varying factors from preferred genres, game lore interests and budget all shape each person's ideal setup. Rather than assumptions, gifts derive maximum thoughtfulness from listening openly to learn another's authentic priorities. This approach validates the receiver's personality, intelligence and independence instead of projecting the giver's biases upon them. By word and deed demonstrating belief in people of all ages to understand their own gaming interests builds mutual understanding and pleasure within relationships where gaming plays a shared role. Compromise and patience preserve the spirit of gift-giving when budgets require alternative solutions be found together respectfully.
