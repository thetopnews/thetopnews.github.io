### An Idea is Conceived
I had always been fascinated by American history, particularly the events surrounding Abraham Lincoln's presidency and tragic assassination. One night, after pondering what could have been different if the assassination had been prevented, I drifted off to sleep with visions of traveling back in time. Little did I know that my thoughts would manifest into an unexpected reality. 
I suddenly found myself waking up in an unfamiliar place and time. After the initial shock and confusion wore off, I realized with a combination of excitement and nerves that I must have been transported to 1865 Washington D.C., just days before Lincoln's fateful visit to Ford's Theatre. 
My first order of business was to [devise a plan to warn Lincoln of the imminent danger](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-poodle-coffee-latte-winter-christmas-dog-mom-holiday-1). Without modern currency or technology to back my claims, I knew it would be no easy task to gain an audience with the President and convince him to heed my warning. After much thought, I decided my best chance was to intercept Lincoln at the theater and insist on speaking with him directly.

### Making Contact
On the evening of April 14th, I anxiously awaited Lincoln's arrival at Ford's Theatre. When his party finally entered their viewing box, I rushed over and asserted myself past the guards. Lincoln seemed amused by the comical stranger bursting in uninvited but graciously allowed me to explain myself.
Struggling to find credible evidence from 1865 to validate my presence from the future, I began sharing specific details only Lincoln himself would know. When I mentioned the assassination attempt from the summer prior where a bullet grazed his top hat, a look of surprise crossed the President's face. It was then that he started taking me seriously. 
I quickly recounted the events of that fateful night to come if prevention measures were not taken. Lincoln's curiosity turned to concern as the door handle began rattling, signaling the arrival of the would-be assassin. Together with the Major and my improvised weapons, we prepared to protect the President at all costs.
### Thwarting Tragedy 
Just moments before the door burst open, Lincoln called for security assistance upon my insistence. A crowd rushed the box as the pounding grew louder. When the door finally opened, **John Wilkes Booth was nowhere to be found among the initial group**. He must have fled upon hearing the commotion, realizing his plan had been foiled.
The theater erupted in chaos and confusion as word spread of the attempted attack. After ensuring Lincoln's safety, I slipped away unnoticed in the panic. Finally allowing the adrenaline to subside, I collapsed in exhaustion and relief. **My mission to save Abraham Lincoln and change the course of history had been a success**.
### Ripples in Time
In the weeks that followed, Lincoln redoubled security and remained cautiously optimistic for the future. My startling tale of time travel was met with equal parts intrigue and skepticism. Speculation ran rampant over what other impacts saving the President could have nationwide. 
During Reconstruction, **Lincoln's steady leadership helped guide the process of rebuilding the Union.** With his moral authority and vision still at the helm, dissent and unrest were kept to a minimum. Racial inequalities were directly confronted through progressive policies protecting freedmen's rights.
By the 1876 election, sectional divides had substantially healed under Lincoln's continued presidency. The controversial outcome and aftermath of political compromise were averted. America entered a new era of prosperity, confident in preserving hard-won unity and upholding the highest principles of equality for all. 
My journey spanning over a century came to an unexpected close the night I saved Lincoln. As mysteries of time travel remain unsolved, I take comfort in believing the ripples of change will echo through generations to come.
