## Introduction
In this guide, we will show you how to customize your Nintendo 3DS by installing custom firmware (CFW). **Custom firmware** allows you to **unlock additional features**, **install homebrew applications and emulators**, and **back up your device for preservation**. Follow our step-by-step instructions to take full control over your system.
### What is Custom Firmware?  
Custom firmware (CFW) is a modified version of the Nintendo 3DS system software that grants access to additional features and functionality. We will cover how to install a popular CFW called Luma3DS to remove restrictions and open up a world of possibilities.

## Preparing Your System
The first step is making sure your device is ready for the install process. 
### Check Your Firmware Version
We need to check that your device firmware is below a certain version to proceed. We will show you how to find your version number in the System Settings.
### Create Backups and Disable Features
It's important to back up any important data and disables system features before hacking. We will guide you through backing up saves and SD card data as well as disabling online features for safety.
## Installing Homebrew Launcher 
Now that our system is prepared, it's time to gain access to homebrew applications and custom firmware payloads.
### Use a Free DSiWare Game and Website
One of the easiest entry points is to install the Homebrew Launcher by exploiting a free DSiWare title and using a simple browser-based tool. We will provide detailed steps for using this “freeshop” method.
### Homebrew Brings New Possibilities  
With the Homebrew Launcher installed, we can now run homebrew programs and experiment with new functionality outside of Nintendo's official experience.
## Installing the Luma3DS Custom Firmware
It's now time to install a permanent custom firmware (CFW) for full access and convenience.
### Download Required Files and Tools
We will explain where to acquire the CFW payload files as well as any additional software required for installation such as GodMode9 and FBI.
### Using Fredtool to Install Boot9strap
One of the easiest methods currently uses a simple web-based installation process courtesy of Fredtool to install the essential boot9strap CFW component.
## Completing the Luma3DS Install
Now that we have boot9strap installed, it's time to wrap up the CFW installation process.
### Follow Flipnote Studio Steps to Boot CFW  
To finalize booting into CFW on every system start, we need to perform one last step using Flipnote Studio as a vector. 
### CFW Installation is Complete
With these steps finished, you now have the full functionality and power of Luma3DS custom firmware installed on your device!
## Removing Traces of Installation  
Now that CFW is running smoothly, we can clean things up a bit.  
### Overwrite Installed DSiWare Game
To cover our tracks, it's a good idea to overwrite the exploited DSiWare title used in the install process for an extra layer of security. 
### Restore Default Firmware if Needed 
We provide instructions for restoring your device firmware in case you ever need to sell your system or want to go back to stock for any reason.
## Using Homebrew and Custom Firmware
Now it's time to start enjoying your newly hacked Nintendo 3DS!
### Installing Homebrew Apps and Emulators  
We will show you how to install homebrew Channel Loaders, emulators, and other apps by placing files on your SD card and using the FBI installer.  
### Backing Up Your Nintendo 3DS
To preserve save data and your existing software, it's important to back up your Nintendo 3DS NAND and System Memory (SysNAND). We explain the process using GodMode9.
### Further Customization Options
Finally, we provide some ideas for additional customizations like custom boot animations, installing custom themes, and backing up individual game saves.
