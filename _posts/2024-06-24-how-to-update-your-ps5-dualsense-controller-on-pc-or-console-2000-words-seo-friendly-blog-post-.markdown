## Part 1 - Introduction 
Sony has recently released a **PC application** that allows PS5 DualSense controllers to be updated without needing a direct connection to a PlayStation 5 console. Previously, the **only update method** was to connect the controller using a USB cable to a PS5. This new software gives **PC gamers** added flexibility to keep their DualSense controllers up to date, even if they do not own a PlayStation console. 
In this multi-part guide, we will cover the system requirements, download process, and setup instructions for the DualSense firmware updater on Windows PCs. We will also outline the two methods for updating directly from a PS5 console via either an internet connection or USB drive. Finally, some general tips are provided for successfully completing controller updates.
## Part 2 - System Requirements for the DualSense Updater on PC
The minimum PC specifications required to run the DualSense firmware updater include having either Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed. Your display also needs to be at least **1024x768 resolution** to properly view the installation interface. You'll need approximately **10MB of free storage space** available to download and extract the application files. Most importantly, you'll require an available USB port and cable to connect the DualSense controller to your computer. Provided your system meets these straightforward **requirements**, you'll be ready to download the updater software.
## Part 3 - Downloading and Installing the Updater Application  
To get started with downloading the DualSense updater for Windows, go directly to the Sony support page and look for the **"DualSense Wireless Controller"** software section. Click the link to download the latest version of the **"DualSense Firmware Updater"** installation file. This will be saved as a compressed ZIP folder. Extract the files to a new local folder on your computer. Next, open the folder and run the setup application inside. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process. Upon restarting your PC, the updater will be ready to locate and apply any available controller firmware updates.
## Part 4 - Connecting and Updating the Controller  
Once installed, launch the DualSense updater program from your desktop or Start menu. With the controller connected to your PC using a USB cable, the software should automatically detect it. If prompted, use the PlayStation button in the center of the controller to put it into pairing mode. The updater will then check online for any new firmware versions. If an update is available, follow the on-screeninstructions and buttons prompts to initiate the download and installation process. It's important **not to disconnect the USB cable** or turn off the controller until the update fully completes, which usually takes only a few minutes.
## Part 5 - Updating Directly from a PS5 Console 
Owners of a PlayStation 5 console have two straightforward options for keeping their DualSense controllers up to date directly from the system. The easiest method is to go to Settings > System Software > System Software Update and let the PS5 automatically download and apply any available updates over an internet connection. Alternatively, you can manually download the latest update file package from PlayStation's website and transfer it using a USB drive. From there, go to Settings > System Software > System Update and initiate the installation process from the selected USB storage device.
## Part 6 - Manually Downloading PS5 Updates  
For those wanting more control over the PS5 system update process, it's possible to manually download firmware packages. First, go to Settings > System Software > System Update > Update System Software. Here you'll see if an update is available but you can also select "Update via Internet" or "Update via USB Storage Device." If choosing the USB option, you'll need to download the update file from PlayStation's support site on another device. Transfer this zipped folder to an empty USB drive formatted to exFAT or FAT32. With the drive inserted in your PS5, you can locate and select the update file to initiate the installation.
## Part 7 - General tips for a smooth controller update
To avoid any potential issues when updating your DualSense controller, follow some general best practices. Only attempt to update one controller at a time rather than multiple units simultaneously. Keep your controller constantly powered on and the connection cable firmly plugged in for the duration of the update process. And be sure your controller firmware is always using the very latest version released by Sony - this helps fix bugs and adds new features over time. Taking these small steps will help guarantee smooth and successful updates of your DualSense controllers every time new firmware becomes available.
## Part 8 - Recap and Closing Thoughts 
In summary, Sony has made it quite simple to keep DualSense controllers up to date whether connecting directly to a PS5 console or using the new dedicated firmware updater software on Windows PCs. The PC application removes previous barriers that required a PlayStation system. Owners now have flexibility in how and where they can update their controllers. Regularly installing the latest firmware releases is recommended, as it helps improve performance, address any issues, and potentially unlocks added functionality down the road. With a USB connection and just a few button presses, keeping DualSense controllers current is now a quick and painless process.
