The Vietnam War was one of the most controversial wars in American history. From 1955 to 1975, over 2.7 million American men were sent to fight in Vietnam. Many young men strongly opposed the war for moral or political reasons. At the same time, they wanted to avoid criminal charges for draft dodging. This article explores some of the **legal and unpopular options** available to dodge the Vietnam War draft while avoiding imprisonment.
### Enlisting to Gain More Control
One option was for young men to voluntarily enlist instead of getting drafted. By enlisting, they could choose their branch of service (like the Air Force or Navy), exact training, and start date. This gave more control over their military career compared to being drafted by the **Army draft board**. Draftees had little say and were far more likely to be placed in combat infantry roles in Vietnam. While still serving, enlisting provided a legal path with some advantages over involuntary conscription.

### Student Deferments 
Many received student deferments from the draft by enrolling in a college or university. These deferments allowed students to delay combat service until graduation for up to four years. However, when that protection ended, **many college graduates still got drafted right away.** Deferments only pushed back confrontation with the draft, not eliminated the future requirement to serve. Still, education deferments gave temporary shelter from the war for thousands trying to finish school before facing military obligations.
### Medical Exemptions 
Another option was obtaining a medical exemption from the draft board. Some men did have legitimate physical or mental health issues that made them unfit for service like asthma, injuries or disabilities. For others, questionable **medical conditions** provided grounds for an exemption. While dodging the draft this way wasn't truly "honorable," it let these men avoid Vietnam without facing charges. Exemptions could be temporary or permanent depending on the stated condition. 
### National Guard or Reserves
Joining the National Guard or military reserves was a semi-legal path for deferred or part-time service. However, reserve units became increasingly full as more tried to enlist this way. **Connections with officers** helped some get placements ahead of long waiting lists. While not a foolproof way out of Vietnam, reserves allowed fulfilling duty obligations stateside instead of overseas combat deployment for those accepted. 
### Graduate Deferments
Pursuing graduate or professional degrees in fields like medicine, law or theology allowed deferments from the draft. These extended **educational deferments** were usually only granted annually and required maintaining high academic standing. Still, advanced degrees gave another temporary safe harbor from conscription for those accepted to competitive programs. Additional schooling also delayed confrontation with service obligations. 
### Hard-to-Replace Defense Jobs
Men working in occupations crucial to the war effort, like positions with **major weapons contractors**, could obtain exemptions from the draft board to keep those skills employed domestically. These exemptions depended on one's employer directly requesting the exemption and demonstrating why that individual was invaluable to ongoing defense projects. Not all industries or jobs qualified a man for exemptions this way. 
### Joining Critical Public Services
For those morally opposed to fighting but willing to serve, conscientious objector status provided an alternative. These men performed **non-combat public service** roles like civilian work with the American Red Cross overseas or stateside public health services. These options let objectors fulfill military obligations through non-military work instead of combat or support roles. Documentation of beliefs was required to avoid charges as a draft dodger.
### Educational Travel Overseas
Applying to competitive graduate programs in other countries offered draft deferments for Americans accepted abroad. This allowed fleeing overseas for the duration of one's foreign degree. However, returning home after school still meant facing military service requirements eventually. Many Canadians also helped by accepting American draft dodgers as students or refugees.
### Lobbying Local Draft Boards  
Draft boards had broad leeway in granting exemptions or deferments during the Vietnam era due to insufficient oversight. Well-connected families with pull in their local communities found ways to lobby for their sons. **Political favors** allowed some to dodge service through board lobbying even without qualification for deferments. Socioeconomic advantage played a role for those not facing the draft equally.
### Fleeing as a Last Resort
For strong war objectors, fleeing to Canada or other countries provided the only means to fully dodge service without facing imprisonment. However, this required permanently giving up one's American citizenship. An **estimated 50,000-100,000** American men became draft dodgers or exiles during Vietnam according to government records. Later presidential pardons allowed many resisters to return safely. 
In summary, the Vietnam War era draft presented young American men with difficult choices around military service that affected their lives forever. While draft dodging remains controversial, this era demonstrated citizens' agency to dissent and pursue honorable alternatives within an imperfect system. With wisdom and nonviolence, many found ways to avoid the war that respected their conscience while avoiding criminal charges. The options available were limited but gave room for principled objection within legal bounds.
