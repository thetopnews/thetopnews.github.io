### Introduction
Minecraft is enjoyed by players of all ages around the world. Its creative sandbox worlds and survival gameplay create an experience that is deeply personal yet also deeply social. The Nintendo Switch version of Minecraft, known as **Bedrock Edition**, takes this social aspect to new heights by enabling multiplayer across different devices and platforms. Whether you want to build, battle, or just hang out with friends, the Switch makes co-op crafting convenient and accessible. 
This guide will provide a detailed overview of the various multiplayer options available in **Minecraft for Nintendo Switch** and how to set each one up. We'll explore **local wireless and online multiplayer** for connecting Switch consoles near and far. We'll also cover using external **Minecraft servers** for persistent worlds. By the end, you'll be an expert in forming collaborative communities and taking your creations to exciting new levels with others. So grab your friends and get ready to Minecraft together!

### Local Wireless Play for Close Quarters Crafting 
One of the easiest ways to dive into **Switch multiplayer Minecraft** is through local wireless multiplayer. This allows players to connect their Switches together without an internet connection, as long as the devices are within a short physical distance of each other — usually around 30 feet. 
To get started, go to the main menu on your Switch and select the "Online" option from the sidebar. Then choose "Local Wireless" from the pop-up menu. This will broadcast your game for others nearby to find and join. Have your friends do the same to surface their games. Once found, simply select the worlds you both want to play in to begin an seamless split-screen session. 
Local wireless has some limitations. It only supports connecting Switches and doesn't allow integrating with other Bedrock platforms like Xbox, Android, iOS or Windows 10. But for casual **Switch-exclusive multiplayer**, it's perfect for flexible co-op play anywhere indoors or out. Just gather your closest adventurers and let the crafting commence!
### Spanning Platforms with Microsoft Accounts 
To truly experience the breadth of **cross-platform Minecraft multiplayer**, you'll need to link your Nintendo Switch to a Microsoft account. This unlocks the magic of playing with friends across Windows, mobile devices, other consoles and more. 
Setting up a free Microsoft account takes just a few quick steps. Log into the account on your Switch via the official site from the system's web browser. Once signed in, all your friends on other platforms who also use Microsoft accounts will automatically appear. Then it's as simple as joining their worlds or inviting them into yours.
Adding strangers is also possible through their unique usernames. Having everyone connected through a centralized Microsoft profile brings an unprecedented level of coordination and compatibility to group play. You aren't restricted to a single platform or even proximity anymore. Worlds are now shared across any device.
All told, linking to Microsoft truly unleashes the social promises of Bedrock Edition. It opens up a limitless global community of players to discover, team up with, and build unlimited **cross-platform worlds** alongside.
### Online Multiplayer Across Distances
Now that everyone's linked through Microsoft, it's time to take multiplayer Minecraft beyond local wireless and spread out across distances. The Switch allows for robust online multiplayer through several methods. 
First, friends can simply join each other's open **Minecraft worlds** from the online menu. No servers or additional steps needed. Privacy is maintained through permissions.
For more persistent worlds, a **private Realm subscription** rented monthly from Microsoft offers dedicated servers. Here, moderating admins can fine-tune settings, invite precisely who they want, and know the world will be reliably online 24/7 for all members regardless where located. 
Public servers also connect groups. However, they lack oversight over moderation, plugins or persistent worlds. **Self-hosted private servers** address this but require technical know-how, separate server hardware and ongoing maintenance.
No matter the method, **online Minecraft worlds** unite separated friends across any place or platform. The social experience faces no boundaries, just endless cooperative adventures in infinite procedurally-generated lands.
### Finding and Exploring Public Servers 
While private worlds have their place, public servers open up discovery on a whole new scale. Here, thousands of unique pre-built maps, mini-games, creative parks and more await exploration at the tips of switch players' fingers. 
The easiest way to start browsing is via server listing sites aggregated from across the Bedrock community. Examples include **Minecraft-MP** or the **Planet Minecraft** hub. Filters let you target server types, activity levels, locations and more. Descriptions provide overviews so un joining you have a sense of expectations. 
Quality servers provide structured rule sets clearly listed, active admin monitors and proper support channels if issues arise. Look for recently updated maps populated by friendly helpful players. Avoid servers that seem empty, unmoderated or lacking basic info/policies. 
Some servers focus on casual building and chatting together. **Mini-game arenas** pit players against each other or zombies in Tower Defense, Parkour and other modes. **Creative hubs** invite showing off incredible structures or arts for communities to appreciate.
Public servers unveil an incredible depth of community-driven content. With care taken in server selection, they make discovering wildly variant universes and like-minded players globally tremendously fun and easy for Switch Minecrafters.
### DIY Dedicated Server Hosting for the Ultra-Committed 
While rented servers and pre-built public options satisfy many, serious minecraft players may want fully customized persistent worlds under their own control. Dedicated server hosting provides the most tailored environments but comes with higher involvement. 
As an alternative to private Realms, self-hosted servers require separate physical server hardware or a VPS (Virtual Private Server) instance. Technical aptitude is needed to properly install the **Minecraft Bedrock server software**, configure startup options, set memory/CPU resources and open necessary network ports. 
Plug-ins add limitless possibilities through modular scripts that alter gameplay logic, implement game modes, manage permissions and much more. However, they require learning scripting languages like JavaScript to develop customizations. 
Day-to-day, servers must stay online and monitored continuously so the world remains accessible. Software and OS updates must be managed carefully as well. **Uptime** becomes a concern requiring redundancy or failover solutions to safeguard persistent worlds. 
For the dedicated community administrator, self-hosting grants supreme control over look, feel and experience down to the last line of code. It retains independence over updates and policies too. But it also demands serious ongoing technical commitment compared to hosted options. Weigh costs carefully before embarking on hosting your own long-term playgrounds.
### Conclusion: Bringing People Together Through Play 
Wherever life's adventures may lead, the Switch version of Minecraft ensures creative expression and meaningful gaming experiences stay portable. Its revolutionary **cross-platform functionality** pioneered by Bedrock Edition breaks down barriers to unite friends from any corner of the Earth within infinite randomly-generated lands.
By leveraging Microsoft accounts, online multiplayer and a selection of complementary tools, close-knit groups and far-flung communities alike gain new ways to bond through play. Creativity, ingenuity and good times become accessible tools for forging connections no matter one's location.
For builders, adventurers, mini-game athletes or anyone who simply wants to have fun collaborating together, this guide has hopefully illuminated the diverse possibilities to grow your world however—and with whomever—you choose. Now go forth and start crafting community without limits! Your imagination and those you share it with hold the power to build worlds without boundaries.
