### **Digital Access to a World of PlayStation Gaming**
While it may seem counterintuitive, it is absolutely possible to purchase PlayStation 4 (PS4) games without physically owning the console. Thanks to digital storefronts and the ability to tie games to your PlayStation Network (PSN) account, gamers have several flexible options for building their game library in advance of getting a PS4. This guide will outline the various methods one can use to buy PS4 titles without the console through both physical and digital means.

### **Shopping for Physical Discs at Local Retailers** 
One of the most straightforward ways to obtain PS4 games without the console is simply visiting your local video game retailer. Major brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and GameStop stock both new and used physical copies of PS4 titles that can be purchased independently of console ownership. By buying discs, your games will be immediately playable once a PS4 is acquired. Make sure to inspect discs for scratches or other damage before purchasing used games. Additionally, keep an eye out for sales and promotions where retailers may offer games at discounted prices.
### **Browsing and Buying Digitally from the PlayStation Store**  
For a completely digital method, you can access the robust PlayStation Store directly through your PC or mobile device's web browser. Signing in with your PSN account allows full browsing and purchasing functionality without needing a PS4 nearby. Peruse new releases, franchise collections, and genre-specific categories before adding desired games to your cart. Make payments securely via credit or debit cards, and your purchased titles will be tied to your account. Later, simply log in to the same PSN on a PS4 to see and download all of your previously acquired games at no extra cost. 
### **Redeeming Prepaid Game Codes for Instant Access**
Another convenient digital option is redeeming prepaid game voucher codes. These can easily be found for purchase online at major retailers, as gifts, or bundled with consoles and bundles. Simply obtain a code for a PS4 title you want, log into your PSN account on the PlayStation store website or mobile app, and enter the long string of digits. The full game will then be immediately available in your download list to play once a PS4 is linked to your account. Prepaid codes provide a low-commitment way to build up your digital library ahead of time.
### **Linking Existing PSN Accounts to Explore Hidden Library Gems**  
If you already have an active PSN account from previous console generations like the PS3, it's worth signing in before getting your first PS4. You may discover some hidden gems in your purchased game library that are playable on the newer console through backward compatibility. Even years-old downloadable purchases could provide hours of entertainment as you await your PS4. Taking some time to look through and re-download old favorites is a great use of the waiting period.
### **Playing Games Without a PlayStation Plus Subscription**
While a PlayStation Plus membership provides valuable benefits like monthly free games, online multiplayer access, and automatic game saves to the cloud, it is not an absolute necessity for enjoying games you purchase separately. You can buy both physical discs and digital titles from the PlayStation Store without needing an active PS Plus subscription. Games will function normally in single-player modes without the online service. Consider PS Plus as an optional luxury rather than a mandatory cost for those primarily interested in gaming offline or single-player focused experiences. 
### **Maximizing the Console Unboxing Experience**  
By employing some of these methods to obtain PS4 games ahead of getting your console, you setup the ultimate new hardware unboxing experience. Power on that first PS4 knowing your coveted library is already lined up and ready to download thanks to prior planning. Browse through titles, select your first game, and start playing within minutes rather than hours of setup - the perfect launch day experience. Also consider preloading any large game files beforehand onto an external hard drive for seamless next-gen gaming from the very first moment.
In summary, whether buying physical discs from local shops or browsing expansive digital storefronts online, the PS4 offers gamers remarkable flexibility to start growing their collection well before the console arrives. Through existing PSN accounts and prepaid codes, it's easy to tie purchased games securely to profiles for future access. Employing these strategies lets you prepare an impressive selection of titles to eagerly jump into on day one with your new PlayStation 4.
