## Part 1 - Exploring the Worlds of Destiny 2 Without PS Plus
Destiny 2 offers a vast universe filled with beautiful worlds just waiting to be explored. As a lone guardian, you can freely roam the planets and complete solo quests without needing a PS Plus membership. The diverse open maps like Earth, the Dreaming City, and beyond provide countless hours of discovery as **you scout for resources, defeat enemies, and uncover hidden secrets. Solo players enjoy complete freedom to follow waypoints, advance the story at their own pace, and experience the lore of Destiny's living worlds**. 
### Scouting the EDZ
One of the earliest destinations, the European Dead Zone (EDZ) on Earth serves as a perfect starting point. Wander through the rustic ruins taking in vistas of towering cliffs and winding rivers. Keep an eye out for materials to gather and public events where you can assist other nearby guardians against challenging foes. The EDZ gifts an accessible introduction to Destiny's vibrant environments.
