## Introduction
The PS5 comes with built-in storage, but for many gamers the default 667GB is simply not enough in this era of massive game downloads and updates. Over time, installations can quickly fill the drive, forcing users to delete games to make room for new titles. To fully enjoy their PlayStation library without restrictions, savvy players have been eagerly awaiting the ability to expand storage. In this guide, we will outline how upgrading to an NVMe solid state drive can future-proof your PS5 storage needs for years of gaming to come.
### **The Limited Capacity of PS5 Internal Storage** 
Out of the box, the PS5 only allocates 667GB of usable space for games and other downloads from its 825GB SSD. With modern titles weighing in at 50-100+GB a piece, high quality textures and downloadable content, the internal storage fills up after only a handful of game installations. To manage space, players must continuously juggle their libraries by erasing completed games.

## Choosing the Right NVMe Drive
### **Sony's Next-Gen Performance Requirements**
While the PS5 has an M.2 slot to support third party expansions, Sony has not enabled compatibility through system software updates yet. To deliver the breakneck speeds of the PS5's solid state architecture, any M.2 drive added must meet exacting standards. When firmware unlocking is rolled out, expect Sony to share the minimum **read/write speeds** and other technical specs required for reliability and full performance.
## Preparing for Sony's Update  
### **Monitoring for the Latest PS5 System Updates**
Until Sony activates third party SSD expansion, PS5 owners have no choice but to closely monitor for software updates that unlock the M.2 slot. Sign up for PS5 update alerts from Sony direct or gaming publications to know as soon as compatibility goes live. With next-gen NVMe drives hitting the market regularly, it pays to stay up to date on PlayStation news for when expanded storage finally becomes available.
## Installing Your New SSD 
### **Physically Installing an NVMe Drive in the PS5**  
Once Sony provides the go-ahead through firmware, physically installing an M.2 drive is remarkably simple. Power off the PS5 fully before beginning. Remove the outer side panel to access the expansion bay beneath a small cover. Securely insert the drive and replace all panels. With only a single screw required and no tools needed, drive installation poses minimal technical challenges. 
### **Formatting and Initializing the Drive**
After powering up the PS5 with the new SSD inserted, the console will prompt to fully format and initialize it for use. This prepares the drive by installing the necessary file system and partitions it to work seamlessly within the PlayStation ecosystem. The format process can take 10-20 minutes depending on storage capacity.
## Maximizing Your Expanded Storage
### **Transferring and Managing Game Installs**  
Once initialized, drives show up like expanded internal storage that games, apps and media can be saved to. Users can choose to re-download titles or selectively transfer existing game files over from the internal drive using simple menus within the PS5's storage settings. With large new drives, cleanly organizing installs across both internal and external drives is important for easy access down the line.   
### **Quick Travel between Games without Long Waits**
One major benefit of NVMe solid state performance is the ability to quickly suspend one game, load another nearly instantly, then jump back without long loading pauses. Housing your complete library on ultra-fast expanded storage means seamless, lag-free transitions between any titles on your drive - a level of fluidity impossible with external HDDs.
## Choosing the Best Drive Capacity  
### **Balancing Storage Size and Budget**
The top SSD models will offer capacities ranging from 500GB up to multi-terabyte drives. Considering most AAA game installs hover around 50-100GB each, a 1-2TB drive can store 10-20 modern titles while leaving headroom for future additions. Those seeking maximum storage value may opt for larger 4-8TB SSDs if budget allows. Buy based on current and projected future storage needs without overspending.
### **Future-Proofing with Leading NVMe Technology**  
Look for top-tier drives like the Samsung 980 Pro featuring PCIe Gen4 support and **read/write speeds above 7GB/s** - bandwidth that matches next-gen console requirements. These flagship SSDs ensure maximum performance both now and for years ahead as games push the limits of technological demands. Pay a slight premium for a future-proof solution that serves as a long-term expansion investment.
## Expanding PS5 Storage: Conclusion
### **A Long-Term Solution for Unlimited Gaming**
With supported third-party NVMe SSDs, PlayStation fans gain the freedom and flexibility to build a permanent game library without storage apprehensions. Choose wisely and an external drive can boost your PS5's capacity exponentially for minimal cost compared to re-buying consoles or storage upgrades. With expanded storage arriving soon, it signals an end to the frustrations of storage management and the start of limitless next-gen gaming enjoyment on the PS5 platform.
