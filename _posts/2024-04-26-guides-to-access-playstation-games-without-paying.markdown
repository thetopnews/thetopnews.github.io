## Part 1: Game Sharing with Close Friends 
Game sharing is a feature of the PlayStation Network that allows users to essentially share their digital game libraries with one other PlayStation account. By designating another user's PS4 as your "primary PS4", they will have access to download and play any of the games you own digitally. At the same time, you can continue downloading and playing those same games on your own non-primary console. 
This offers a few key benefits. **Firstly**, both users have access to the full game library owned by the primary account holder. **Secondly**, there is no limit to the number of games that can be shared in this way. However, only one user can actively play a digital title at a given time. So if you both wanted to play the same game simultaneously, only the account holder could do so. 
The setup process is **fairly straightforward**. Within your account settings on PlayStation, simply activate the "Primary PS4" option for a friend's console. Then they can browse your games in the PlayStation Store and download any titles to play for free. Just be sure only one of you plays a particular game at once to avoid issues.
### Take Turns with Cooperative Campaigns
Game sharing opens the door to enjoying cooperative game campaigns with a friend even if only one of you owns the title. By taking turns hosting online or sharing a single console, you can experience the full story together without both spending money upfront. Popular series like Call of Duty and Battlefield really shine in this shared format.

## Part 2: **Jailbreaking Older PS4 Consoles**
For PS4 owners still on older firmware versions below version 4.55, it was possible to "jailbreak" or hack their consoles in order to run homebrew applications and even install pirated game copies. While this practice is no longer viable on modern firmware, it remains an option for older systems not yet updated. 
After jailbreaking, a whole new world of capabilities and customization becomes available. Homebrew tools allow everything from emulating older consoles to tweaking system menus and settings. More controversially, cracked game copies can also be downloaded and played without purchasing through Sony. 
Naturally, there are some risks to consider as well. Jailbreaking voids your console's warranty, and there is always a possibility of your PSN account getting banned if detected playing pirated games. Security exploits used in the initial hack process also run the risk of being patched in future system updates.
### Find Alternative Use Cases Beyond Piracy
For those seeking to experiment without resorting to piracy, jailbroken consoles open many creative options. Homebrew lets users run emulators, stream PC games, or even learn basic programming. With care taken to avoid Sony's servers, a hacked system remains functional for alternative uses away from pirated software.
## Part 3: Explore the Wide World of **Free-to-Play Games**
The PlayStation Store front page prominently features a carousel of free-to-play games available for download at no cost. Spanning many popular genres from shooters to RPGs to card games, this section houses some truly massive titles.
Two consistent chart-toppers are **Fortnite** and **Apex Legends**, with their flashy action and seamless cross-play. For something more relaxed, **Warframe** and **Sky: Children of the Light** provide beautiful worlds to explore solo or with friends. Strategy fans can sink hours into digital card games like **Hearthstone** and **Legends of Runeterra**.
Most titles adopt a "freemium" model where optional in-game purchases speed progress but don't impact core gameplay. This means you can log hundreds of hours across multiple free titles, entertaining yourself without ever spending a dime upfront. Just be sure to check system requirements, as some demand beefier hardware to run smoothly.
### Find Hidden Gems Beyond Blockbusters 
Digging deeper beyond the front page reveals many lesser-known freebies also worth a look. **Dauntless** delivers monster-hunting action, **Brawlhalla** brings platform fighting, and **War Thunder** simulates combat across land, sea and air. With patience, even niche genres have free offerings to potentially find a new obsession.
## Part 4: Test Before You Invest with **Game Trials**
Game developers and publishers regularly offer limited-time free trials for major new releases, letting curious gamers get hands-on before committing to a purchase. These come in two main forms - conventional demos with strict time limits, or full game "trials" granting restricted access for a few days. 
Demos historically came on game discs as a teaser, but digital distribution enables quick trials more broadly. Notable recent examples include the **Elden Ring** Closed Network Test and the **Horizon Forbidden West** beta trial period on PSN. Both granted early looks before the big launch dates.
Full game trials provide the full standard experience, but restrict playtime to encourage purchasing. This lets you thoroughly explore the first few story missions, side activities, and core mechanics risk-free before deciding. Popular online-focused games like **Destiny 2** and **World of Warcraft** also offer generous free periods regularly.
### Evaluate Gameplay Loops and Genre Fit 
By progressing far enough into the core gameplay loop, trials give a true feel for whether a title (and its price tag) will suit your tastes. Evaluate factors like control schemes, pacing, challenge levels, and social features to gauge long-term interest and enjoyment potential. This hands-on testing far surpasses watching pre-rendered marketing videos alone.
## Part 5: Stack Up Your Library with PlayStation Plus Free Games
A core perk of PlayStation Plus is access to 2-4 free games each month, yours to keep as long as your subscription remains active. Spanning every major genre on PS4 and PS5, the selection provides constant variety and value. 
February 2022's lineup includes popular **EA Sports titles like UFC 4 and Planet Coaster**, alongside narrative adventure **Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep**. With a back catalog of over 300+ total freebies since 2013, it's easy for PS+ to pay for itself if you play multiple "free" games each year.
New games are added on the first Tuesday of each month, letting subscribers build up an on-demand library over time. There's something for everyone, from action games like **Ghost of Tsushima** to indie darlings like **Celeste**. PS+ collections on PS5 also include big PS4 hits like **God of War** to enjoy with boosted compatibility.
### Reap Ongoing Rewards Beyond the Games 
On top of the monthly free games, PlayStation Plus offers permanent discounts in the PlayStation Store, exclusive betas/demos, and cloud saves. The online multiplayer component is also only accessible for PS Plus members. All told, it's easy to get many hours of premium entertainment for the low monthly or annual subscription cost.
## Part 6: Limitless Gaming Options with PlayStation Now
As a game streaming subscription, PlayStation Now provides access to well over 700 PS2, PS3 and PS4 titles streamed to your console or PC for as low as $10/month. This includes major franchise hits, cult classics, and genre-defining exclusives spanning all PlayStation eras. 
The wide-ranging catalog includes AAA blockbusters like the entire Metal Gear Solid and God of War series. Meanwhile, you can relive beloved PS2-era games like Ico, Sly Cooper, and Ratchet & Clank without needing old hardware. PS3 games are streamed using cloud infrastructure, while PS4 games can also be downloaded natively on consoles. 
Games are instantly playable across a variety of supported devices with internet access. PS Now on PC in particular offers a new flexible way to enjoy the PlayStation experience anywhere a laptop goes. Streaming technology has also come a long way, providing smooth 1080p gameplay at reasonable speeds for most subscribers. 
### Rediscover PlayStation's Deep Back Catalog
Due to PS Now's movie-like Timeline feature, it's fun to simply browse eras and revisit classics amid today's constant stream of new releases. Thrill to the origins of PlayStation's biggest franchises or relive the magic of genre-defining originals before modern remakes. The historic value of this back catalog streaming service cannot be overstated.
## Part 7: Take Advantage of Free Weekend Events
As a promotional tactic to draw in new players, major publishers often hold dedicated "free weekends" for a limited time. This gives the whole community an extended free trial window to enjoy specific multiplayer-focused games temporarily without purchase.
For example, **Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege** periodically runs completely free weekends where any interested party can download and play the full current version for a few days. These help boost player counts while also spreading positive word-of-mouth through natural gameplay.
Meanwhile on PlayStation, look out for free weekends from studios like **Ubisoft** featuring newer games like **Assassin's Creed Valhalla**. Not only does it let curious players freely immerse themselves in massive open worlds for once, it's also a prime opportunity to experience addicting online modes with a temporarily boosted community. 
Be sure to keep an eye on PlayStation Store banners and news articles for the next major free weekend event. Even normally pricey live service games become totally accessible for just
