## Part 1: Controller Support Evolution
### Native Controller Support Added 
When Diablo 3 was initially released on PC, it did not have native controller support. This made mapping skills and navigating with a controller difficult, especially for console gamers used to this control scheme. **While mouse and keyboard give more precise control, some players prefer the comfort of a controller**. The Steam Controller helped make mouse emulation and mapping skills to the touchpads and buttons easier. However, standard Xbox and PlayStation controllers were not as seamlessly supported without third party tools.

### Full Controller Support with Console Releases
When Diablo 3 was ported to consoles like PlayStation and Xbox, it naturally had full controller support designed from the ground up. This included intuitive joystick and button bindings for skills and movement. **PlayStation 4 Diablo 3** games showcased how the action-RPG could translate well to controllers. 
### PC Controller Parity after Console Success 
Seeing the console popularity and control scheme praise, Blizzard added full native controller support to the PC versions as well starting with patch 2.0 in 2013. This allowed both mouse/keyboard and controller players to enjoy the full PC experience. **Controller support on PC Diablo 3** removed a barrier for those more comfortable with gamepads. Though the stash system is still more optimized for mouse navigation on PC.
## Part 2: Major Game Changes Since Launch
### Adventure Mode and Removal of Real Money Auction House
At launch in 2012, Diablo 3 had an real-money auction house where players could buy and sell rare items with actual currency. However, this incentivized farming only for profits rather than enjoyment. In patch 2.0 in 2013, Blizzard removed the auction house and added Adventure Mode. This separated the story from randomized endgame content like **Bounties, Rifts, and Greater Rifts** which had more rewarding gameplay loops.
### New Classes, Abilities and Legendary Sets
Two new classes - the Crusader and Necromancer - were later added with their own unique abilities and playstyles. All existing classes received significant updates and reworks too. Most notably, class-specific **Legendary Sets** were fully fleshed out with focused bonuses that changed builds and the meta. New legs allowed totally different playstyles.
### Additional Endgame Systems and Quality of Life 
Major additions like Kanai's Cube for crafting and upgrading, Seasons/Season Journeys, Challenge Rifts and more kept the endgame fresh. Countless other smaller changes improved the **quality of life**, like smart loot, enhanced ui, shared stash, cosmetic changes and bug fixes. All worked to refine Diablo 3 into one of the best ARPG experiences.
## Part 3: Obtaining Legendary Sets as Loot Drops
### Higher Torment Difficulties Yield Better Drops
When farming for specific **Legendary Sets**, it's important to play on the highest Torment difficulty level possible. The minimum required is Torment 1, but higher Torment tiers see a noticeable boost to legendary drop rates. Some sets like **Invoker Crusader** may take hours on lower Torments but drop much faster on Torment 13.
### Specific Item Slots have Preferred Drop Rates
Within a given **Legendary Set**, certain armor slots seem to drop more frequently than others based on analysis. For example, **Marauder Demon Hunter** boots and gloves are commonly received before the full six-piece set. Knowing the slot priorities helps target the rarest remaining pieces.
## Part 4: Gambling with Blood Shards
By far the most consistent method is spending Blood Shards with the Mystic Kadala in town. She takes the shards in exchange for random items, with a strong focus on the slot chosen. For example, when gambling for **Helltooth Witch Doctor** arms and shoulders, select the armor slot first before gambling shards. This dramatically improves odds of completing sets over time.
## Part 5: Upgrading Rares in Kanai's Cube
While RNG is still a factor, upgrading yellow quality items with the Cube has a high chance of turning them into specific Legendary and Set items of the same type. For example, Upgrade a two-handed mighty weapon to try and create the **Raekor's Might Weapon** for the Barbarian. Upgrade rares only of the slots needed to efficiently finish sets.
## Part 6: Season Journey Rewards  
Each season, completing tasks in the Seasonal Journey like achieving certain Greater Rift levels or conquests awards cache with guaranteed class sets. For Season 23, the **Uliana's Strand Monk Set** is given out this way for easy access to a complete build. This provides a guaranteed power spike at the start of each season.
## Part 7: Craftable Legendary Sets
A few Legendary Sets can only be obtained through crafted plans, usually found in Bounty Caches or dropped by Treasure Goblins. One example is the **Invoker Crusader Set** which is crafted in the cube using plans from Horadric Cache bounty rewards. Playing seasons ensures access to these alternative acquisition methods. 
## Part 8: Conclusion
Over its lifespan, Diablo 3 greatly expanded the endgame and fine tuned the systems for obtaining Legendary powers and gear. Whether through drops, crafting, upgrading or targeted farming, dedicated players can efficiently acquire even the rarest loot. Continuous updates keep the item hunt relevant and engaging for new and veteran players alike. The focus on targeted farming now makes **Legendary Set completion straightforward with some playtime investment**. With constant improvements and additions, Blizzard has succeeded in keeping Diablo 3's itemization fresh and rewarding years after launch.
