### **Western Post-apocalyptic RPG** Franchise and Developer Prospects
The successful 'Fallout' franchise created by Interplay Entertainment and currently developed and published by Bethesda Softworks has gained a dedicated fan following since the original 1997 game thanks to its compelling post-nuclear wasteland setting and role-playing gameplay. While Bethesda Game Studios (BGS) has enjoyed commercial success developing the last three major Fallout titles, some fans and analysts have speculated on possibilities for collaboration between the franchise and Obsidian Entertainment, the developer known for creating 2010's critically acclaimed 'Fallout: New Vegas'. With announcements of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax Media in early 2021, the landscape for potential cooperation has shifted. This multi-part article will explore the perspectives and prospects for collaboration between Bethesda, Obsidian, and their respective franchises moving forward.

### **Obsidian's Prior Statements on Developing a New Fallout Game**
In past interviews, Obsidian developers have stated they would be open to working on another Fallout project but acknowledged their commitment lies with independently producing their own intellectual properties like 'The Outer Worlds'. They have dismissed the notion of directly developing "Fallout: New Vegas 2" under Bethesda as publisher, likely preferring full creative autonomy over an established franchise they don't own. However, industry analysts believe the Microsoft acquisition changes this calculus, potentially easing collaboration by reducing risks and increasing opportunity for mutually beneficial partnerships between internal studios. While Bethesda still controls the Fallout IP, the corporate alignment under Microsoft could make cooperation more appealing to both parties.
### **InExile as an Alternative for Remastering or Reimagining Classic Fallout Games** 
Another option fans have discussed is Brian Fargo's InExile Entertainment, formed by many original Black Isle Studios developers behind the original 1998 Fallout. As the spiritual successors, InExile may have more potential and interest in revisiting and updating the foundations of the franchise for modern platforms. Their work on similar post-apocalyptic franchises like Wasteland shows the studio understands the essence of the setting. A remaster or remake of Fallout 1 and 2 under InExile could be a way to gain exposure for the classic entries while pleasing fans hoping to re-experience the franchise's storytelling roots in a new technical presentation. 
### **Focusing on Building Outer Worlds as an IP Provides More Longevity and Independence**
Obsidian is likely wary of taking on creative direction of another studio's mature franchise again after the commercially successful but critically polarized Fallout 3 and 4. By focusing on expanding their own growing ** IPs like The Outer Worlds**, they retain full control over the vision and direction of the property. Starting fresh also avoids potentially disappointing expectations of fans who want a New Vegas sequel. While collaborations remain possible, Obsidian is right to prioritize building the value and identity of worlds they solely own to rely less on work-for-hire projects.
### **Overcoming Creative and Business Hurdles for Cooperation Between Studios**  
For any new Obsidian-developed Fallout to happen, both companies and Microsoft would need to agree on amenable terms. BGS may want oversight to keep the franchise's general vision coherent, which could frustrate Obsidian's independence. Business deals would require balanced risk-reward to properly incentivize collaboration over competition between subsidiaries. Aligning creative goals and timelines poses challenges. Some skepticism of outsourcing may persist after Fallout 76's underwhelming launch renewed doubts about third-party involvement. Compromise would be needed on both creative and financial structures for a true partnership instead of work-for-hire to develop in a way all parties view as mutually beneficial. 
### **Fans' Perspective on Lack of Developer Collaboration**
While appreciative of the Fallout world Bethesda has expanded, some fans argue Obsidian's New Vegas showed a stronger understanding of the lore and role-playing mechanics established by Interplay/Black Isle. They perceive BGS as threatened by Obsidian's ability to deliver what they see as a superior game in less time. However, blockbuster sales of Fallout 3 and 4 demonstrate Bethesda's approach still captivates a massive audience. Rather than accusations of jealousy, productive discussions could focus on respectfully incorporating fan-favorite aspects of New Vegas into future mainline entries or side projects to further strengthen the franchise for all.
### **Recent Shift Towards Development Within Owned Studios Indicates Caution on Outsourcing**  
Since acquiring several developers, Bethesda has moved production predominantly in-house rather than relying on third-party contracts, evidenced by Fallout 76, Starfield, and Elder Scrolls VI. This likely stems from desires for closer creative control and cooperation without negotiations between separate companies. After difficulties with outsourced projects, going inward enables clear communication and consistency across releases without concession on IP ownership. While advantageous for management, owning all development capabilities removes potential benefits of external perspective and collaboration that partnerships provide. The acquisition by Microsoft opens doors for synergies between subsidiaries but may not immediately change this direction. 
### **Potential Avenues for Collaboration and the Franchise's Future**
InExile revisiting classic Fallout through well-crafted remakes appeals to nostalgia while respecting the original roots. Obsidian growing The Outer Worlds as their flagship IP maintains creative independence. Bethesda focusing mainline Fallout through first-party studios upholds direction and ownership. Yet avenues remain for increased cooperation like Obsidian assisting with side content, additional DLC, or spin-offs to please fans. Fans and studios engaging constructively could shape discussion towards mutually agreeable collaboration. While full control suits Bethesda, fostering win-win partnerships across Microsoft enhances the Fallout universe for years to come through united efforts within the parent company's family of studios.
