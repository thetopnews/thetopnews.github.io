## Part 1 - Overwhelming Demand at Launch 
The **PlayStation 2 console launch** in 2000 was a spectacle unlike anything the gaming world had seen before. Sony had enjoyed tremendous success with their original PlayStation and gamers were eagerly anticipating the next generation. However, Sony would face an **unprecedented demand** that caught even them off guard. 
### Shortages and Scalping  
Due to manufacturing **delays and limitations**, Sony struggled to meet the initial orders for the PS2. Store shelves stayed empty for weeks as any units that did arrive were instantly sold out. Some desperate gamers resorted to buying consoles from **scalpers on eBay**, paying well over the $300 MSRP. One console sold for an astounding $1,500 on launch day.

### Sales Records Shattered
When the dust settled, it was clear the PS2 launch was a complete smash hit. In just the first **24 hours of availability** in North America, over 500,000 units were sold. This demolished the previous one-day sales record held by the Dreamcast. The week one sales figure topped 1 million, cementing the PS2 as the fastest-selling consumer electronics device ever released. 
## Part 2 - A library to Satisfy any Gamer
No console is successful without great games and the PlayStation 2 had an enviable selection from day one. Titles like **Gran Turismo 3** and **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty** showed off the hardware while **Final Fantasy X** became a system-seller for RPG fans. The **backward compatibility** with PlayStation games only expanded the library further.
### Iconic Third-Party Support 
Third-party publishers jumped at the chance to develop for the PlayStation 2. Rockstar Games raised the bar for open-world games with the massively influential **Grand Theft Auto III**. **Resident Evil Code: Veronica** and **Devil May Cry** thrilled horror and action fans. Even smaller titles found success, showing the market potential of the platform.
### Sports Titles Thrived 
Sports simulations were tremendously popular on the PS2. 2K Sports debuted their iconic **NBA 2K** franchise. EA Sports launched **Madden NFL** to new heights with features like Franchise Mode. Konami sold millions with their long-running **Pro Evolution Soccer** or **Winning Eleven** series in Europe and Asia. 
### JRPG Genre Flourished
Japanese role-playing games, or JRPGs, sold exceptionally well for PS2 owners. **Final Fantasy X** was a landmark title that sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The **Tales** series from Bandai Namco consisted of fan favorites like **Tales of Symphonia**. Atlus found global success with ambitious RPGs like **Persona 3** and **Persona 4**.
