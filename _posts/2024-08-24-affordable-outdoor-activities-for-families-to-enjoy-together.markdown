Families don't need to spend a lot of money to have fun outside. There are countless free and low-cost options available in most communities to get the whole clan active in the fresh air. From picnics in parks to nature hikes on trails, outdoor games, beach days, neighborhood bike rides, exploring gardens and museums, stargazing, drive-in movies, and local festivals - you'll discover ideas below to keep kids entertained for hours without breaking the budget.
###Picnics in the Parks
Picnics are a classic summer activity that the whole family can enjoy without spending much. Pack up some sandwiches, fruit, chips and cookies to keep everyone happy. Don't forget essentials like sunscreen, hats, sunglasses and water bottles. Most parks have playgrounds or open fields for the kids to burn off energy after eating. You may even discover live music or other entertainment on weekends. Many community parks also provide free WiFi, which allows families to stream movies or videos together during mealtime.  
###Hiking Local Nature Trails
With so many well-maintained hiking trails just waiting to be explored, getting outside is easy. Trail maps help plan your route, while a backpack with snacks, water, layers, bug spray and a first aid kit covers essentials. Young kids enjoy searching for bugs, plants and wildlife. Periodic stops to take in the amazing scenery refreshes adults and children. Since most trails allow leashed dogs, the whole pack can come along for fun together in nature.
###Classic Outdoor Games
Spend afternoons in parks playing soccer, Frisbee, hacky sack or flying kites. No equipment is needed beyond what you likely already own. Take turns to keep things friendly. Have contests for longest throws, best juggling skills or hacky sack tricks. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes to run, jump and play for hours in the healthy outdoors. Nearby playgrounds offer extra entertainment during breaks.
###Relaxing Beach Days 
If beaches are accessible, a day at the shore provides endless affordable activities. Build sandcastles, search for seashells, have splashing contests or teach boogie boarding skills. Pack essentials like towels, sunscreen, umbrella and picnic supplies. After all that activity, relaxing with a book is worthwhile while watching the scenic ocean waves.
###Exploring Neighborhood by Bike
For families that already own bicycles, an afternoon bike ride through local streets and paths lets everyone burn energy while seeing new sights. Chart routes avoiding busier roads. Pack a small cooler with water to stay hydrated. See who can spot interesting landscape features, street signs or birds along the way.
###Daytrips to Outdoor Museums and Gardens
Many botanical gardens, children's discovery museums, and historical sites focused on nature offer free or low-cost entry. Wander exhibition halls and trails together as a family to learn something new each visit. Interactive displays especially appeal to curious young minds. Event calendars often include activities like puppet shows, music or science demonstrations. 
###Stargazing Under the Night Sky  
On clear evenings, introducing children to constellations can spark wonder and curiosity about space. Use a stargazing app on your phone to help identify visible patterns overhead. Bundle up and get comfortable gazing for a while with a blanket, chairs or telescope if available. Kids may spot satellites, planets or even shooting stars with some patience.
###Drive-In Movie Theaters
remaining drive-in theaters provide an affordable theatrical experience families can enjoy together in pajamas. Arrive early for good parking and views. Stock up on popcorn, candy or drinks sold on-site. Young ones usually fall asleep before late shows end, providing built-in bedtimes under the stars on the big screen.
###Community Festivals and Events
Check town websites and newspapers for upcoming outdoor festivals, concerts, activities and holiday events in local parks and public spaces. These often include options like outdoor movie nights, fall harvest celebrations, ethnic cultural programs with music and food, children's activity days - perfect for affordable family fun exploring your community.
