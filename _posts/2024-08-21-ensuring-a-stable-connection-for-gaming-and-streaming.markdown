### Choosing the Right Connection Type
Connecting via a wired Ethernet cable will provide the most stable internet connection for gaming and streaming. Ethernet delivers a guaranteed bandwidth without any risk of interference or distance issues that are common with wireless connections. While not always practical or possible in every room of a home, a wired connection is recommended if the setup allows for it. 
For devices that must connect wirelessly, the type of wireless connection you choose can have a big impact on reliability and performance. WiFi connections can suffer from interference from other wireless devices and the distance between your device and the router. Microwaves, baby monitors, and other appliances that emit radio frequency signals have been known to disrupt WiFi even when located in separate rooms. The farther your device is from the router, the weaker and less reliable the WiFi signal will be. 
To minimize lag and ensure a smooth online gaming or streaming experience, an internet speed of at least 30-40 Mbps is generally recommended as a minimum. Faster speeds of 50 Mbps or higher are preferable if multiple devices will be connected simultaneously. While many areas now have broadband speeds reaching over 100 Mbps, it's important to check your actual speed and choose an internet plan that can deliver consistently high speeds, especially during peak usage hours.

### Strengthening Your Wireless Signal 
For devices relying on WiFi, there are some steps you can take to strengthen your wireless signal and improve connectivity reliability. Wireless signals like WiFi get weakened as they pass through walls, with brick and stone having a particularly negative impact on range and strength. Moving your gaming or streaming devices closer to the wireless router can help boost the signal strength.
Devices within closer proximity to the router will have stronger, more consistent connections. It's also important to be aware that neighbors' WiFi networks and any other wireless devices transmitting signals nearby can add radio frequency traffic that weakens everyone's connections. Consider updating your home router to a newer, more powerful model if it's several years old. Mesh networking systems that extend your wireless coverage area throughout the home are also a viable option for strengthening signals in hard to reach areas.
### Remote Play and Lag Concerns
As online multiplayer games and cloud gaming services like **Google Stadia** continue to grow in popularity, the ability to play games remotely away from your home gaming system is appealing. However, lag and connection stability are major concerns, especially when attempting to play over a public WiFi network. 
With the **PlayStation Remote Play** feature, your PS4 **must be in Rest Mode** and connected to a stable home network for it to wake up and allow remote control via the PlayStation app. Enabling the "**Wake Up PS4 in Rest Mode**" option in your PS4's settings menu is required. While you can control your PS4 remotely from outside your home network once connected, a strong, lag-free connection is critical for an enjoyable gameplay experience. 
Some delay or input lag is inevitable when playing games remotely over the internet compared to directly connected to your TV. Connection speed, stability, and distance from the gaming system all impact responsiveness. Future cloud gaming services like Google Stadia and the next PlayStation and Xbox consoles promising faster processing power and networking could help minimize remote play lag. For now, a wired home network provides the best experience.
### Possible Wireless Interference Sources  
In addition to microwaves and baby monitors, any devices emitting radio frequency signals have the potential to interfere with your WiFi connectivity. This includes common household items like Bluetooth speakers, security cameras, cordless phones, and baby monitors. The 2.4GHz wireless band that WiFi operates on is a crowded spectrum with lots of overlapping signals.
Interference causes unreliable connections that may work well one minute but experience lag, disconnections, or slow loading the next. For competitive online multiplayer games or HD video streaming, these unstable conditions severely impact the experience. Symptoms of interference include slow load times, video buffering, inconsistencies in gameplay such as cars driving slowly in racing games. Random lag spikes in ping times and response delays are also signs that your connection is being disrupted.
While separate wireless channels and different transmission protocols aim to prevent cross-device interference, there's only so much available bandwidth to go around. The sheer number of signals competing for airtime increases interference risk even for devices located in separate areas of your home. Minimizing active wireless devices on your network as much as possible helps avoid connectivity issues. 
### Location Matters For Remote Play Experiences
When attempting to remotely play games away from your home gaming console or PC over a public WiFi network, connection quality is not guaranteed. Most public WiFi hotspots at restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and airports utilize internet bandwidth that must be shared among many users simultaneously. This often results in slower speeds and greater instability compared to your personal home network.
Latency sensitive games requiring precise timing or fast reflexes will be most impacted by any lag or packet loss over public WiFi. The experience can range from mildly annoying if you're just chatting with friends or playing casual games to virtually unplayable if attempting serious competitive online multiplayer matches. Unless connection speeds are clearly listed and bandwidth is dedicated solely for your use, home is generally the most reliable location for remote play.
Even within your own residence, WiFi signal strength and reliability can vary significantly depending on location. Thick walls, floors, cabinets or furniture can weaken signals making connections erratic in some parts of the home. Moving closer to the router improves stability, but may not always be possible given room layouts. Ethernet and mesh networking options can help extend strong connectivity throughout the house.
### Wired vs Wireless Approaches  
For the most **lag-free, guaranteed** gaming or streaming experience, a wired Ethernet connection directly connecting your console, computer or streaming device to the router is optimal. Ethernet delivers symmetrical upload and download speeds without risk of radio interference or weak signals disrupting playback. While not always practical depending on room layouts, a wired backhaul between routers and key networking components helps fortify your home's internet backbone.
However, completely wired setups are not feasible in every situation. Wireless connections offer flexibility and convenience but come with tradeoffs compared to their wired counterparts. Problems caused by common interference sources or weak signals cannot occur over an Ethernet cable. But where wires can't reach, mesh networks and powerful routers upgraded to the latest WiFi standards aim to deliver faster speeds and broader coverage more comparable to Ethernet performance. Choosing the right balance depends on individual needs and home networking constraints.
### Advancing Connectivity Technologies
With 5G cellular network rollouts underway promising significantly faster mobile internet access, reliable online gaming away from home may soon become a viable reality. Leading tech companies are also developing advanced 5G home routers to deliver multi-gigabit wireless speeds on par with fiber optic connections. Meanwhile, cloud gaming platforms like Google Stadia could minimize lag by streamlining game code processing onto centralized servers.
As wireless networking standards continue advancing with new iterations of WiFi and devices upgrading to support the latest technologies, connection reliability should steadily improve. Fewer dead zones from interference sources and strengthened over-the-air signals make wireless a more attractive option. Paired with expanding broadband access projects nationwide, advancing connectivity infrastructure aims to make lag-free online gaming and seamless streaming possible virtually anywhere eventually. Maintaining an up-to-date network helps take advantage of each new boost in speed and reliability.
