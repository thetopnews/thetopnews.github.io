Sharing is key for collaboration in the workplace. Whether you need to share apps, files, or other resources across different user accounts on your network, there are many options to choose from. This guide will walk you through the different ways to share programs, data, and permissions between users on Windows devices. We'll break it down into practical steps and best practices to help you find the right sharing solution for your organization's needs.
### Installing Apps for All Users
When installing desktop apps, it's usually best to choose the "Install for All Users" option. This will put a shortcut accessible to all accounts in the commonly shared "Program Files" folder. Even if you choose to install for the current user only, you can simply move the shortcut to the "All Users" folder to make the app available system-wide. Some exceptions like Dropbox install on a per-user basis by default for separate data folders. But in most other cases, installing for all users upfront is more convenient than individual installs.

### Storing Shared Files on a Server
For sharing files across different accounts, saving to a location outside of user-specific folders like "C:\" is recommended. One approach is to store shared files and folders on a file server that all users can access over the network. Assign group permissions so that specified users or entire departments have read/write access as needed. An alternative is cloud-based file sharing services which allow multiple users to access, edit and collaborate on files from any device on any network as long as they have an internet connection.
### Organizing Users Into Groups  
To facilitate easy sharing, user groups like "Accounting" or "Sales" can be created. These groups make it simple to assign blanket permissions to a folder rather than managing each user individually. The IT administrator defines the groups and controls who is added. Common configuration includes giving the accounting group read/write access to financial documents while sales only gets read access. Power users like a CFO may be granted additional administrative privileges compared to other accounting staff members.
### Leveraging Group Policy Management
Once user groups are established, group policies allow fine-tuning access across the entire network. Specific applications and permissions can be assigned or **blocked** for an entire group. For example, the accounting group may be given permission to install and use Excel while **blocking** unrelated programs like PowerShell that they don't need. This centralized management cuts down on help desk tickets compared to configuring each user separately. 
### Supporting Modern Apps
Modern "Metro" style apps on Windows are generally installed on a per-user basis with separate data and settings for each profile. However, there are ways to make these universally available as well. An IT administrator can use the Microsoft Store for Business and sideloading capabilities to package and deploy store apps for all current and future users. Each person still has their own profiles and logged-in state but will find the same core set of approved productivity and line-of-business apps.
### Tailoring Permissions at the User Level
While groups are useful for broad access controls, more granular permissions can be applied directly to specific users when needed. Within the accounting group, certain senior accountants may be given **more privileged** access like read/write to sensitive financial data that regular staff should only view. Or a sales manager gets additional reporting capabilities that field representatives are blocked from. These customizations allow balancing organization-wide policies with unique role-based needs.  
### Leveraging Cloud-Based Collaboration  
Cloud services provide another avenue for sharing resources beyond local networks. Many **productivity applications** and file hosting platforms install once per user but synchronize data across all of a user's devices. This allows seamless access from any computer whether in the office or on the road. The benefit is universal availability, but separate accounts are still required for each individual. Pairing cloud services with on-premises group policies and file sharing offers flexibility in how to securely facilitate work from any location.
### Choosing the Right Mix of Options
There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so evaluating your specific business needs is important. Consider which user roles require what level of access to applications and data. Then determine the best combination of local and cloud-based options. For many scenarios, applying broad user group policies alongside selective file sharing, alongside synchronization services covers all bases. Don't be afraid to leverage the full spectrum of sharing mechanisms at your disposal. With the right configuration, employees can focus on getting work done instead of figuring out access issues.
### Getting Additional Help When Needed
Complex permission scenarios may require assistance from IT. When users need applications, files or permissions that weren't part of the standard deployment, they should contact their internal support team. Well-defined processes ensure access issues get resolved quickly. By establishing clear policies and default configurations upfront, the help desk load is reduced long-term. But a good IT department also stands ready with expertise when the occasional customization is required to keep your business running smoothly.
