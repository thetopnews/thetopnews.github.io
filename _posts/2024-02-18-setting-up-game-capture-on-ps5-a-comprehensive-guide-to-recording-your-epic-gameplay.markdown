### Using the Built-in PS5 Recording Features
The PS5 allows you to easily record and edit gameplay directly from the console. You can **press the Create button at any time to save the last 15-60 minutes of gameplay**. This makes it very simple to capture impromptu highlights or epic boss battles on the fly. **You also have the option to start recording before playing to capture longer gameplay sessions of up to an hour**. Once recorded, videos can be **uploaded directly from the PS5 to popular video sharing sites like YouTube**, allowing you to easily share your recorded moments with friends and fans online. Additionally, the PS5 supports **live streaming directly to platforms such as Twitch**, so you can broadcast your gameplay adventures for all to see. While the built-in recording is very convenient, it only supports resolutions up to 1080p.

### Choosing a Capture Card for Higher Quality Recording 
For those wanting to record in higher resolutions like 4K or 1440p, an external capture card is necessary. A capture card allows you to **record gameplay footage from the PS5 at resolutions and frame rates beyond what the built-in recording supports**. Popular capture cards for recording from a PS5 include the Elgato HD60 S and similar **USB 3.0 models that support recording resolutions up to 4K60**. These options require some initial setup of cables between the PS5, your gaming PC or laptop, and your display. However, **once configured they allow capturing smoother, higher quality gameplay footage that can be uploaded in pristine quality to YouTube or Twitch**.
### Setting Up the Elgato HD60 S Capture Card
Let's go through the step-by-step setup of the Elgato HD60 S capture card as an example. **First, connect the included USB Type-C cable from the capture card to an open USB 3.0 port on your PC or laptop**. This will provide the necessary bandwidth to handle high-resolution recordings. **Next, use an HDMI cable to connect from the HDMI output port on your PS5 to the "HDMI In" port on the capture card**. **Another HDMI cable then runs from the "HDMI Out" port on the capture card to your gaming display, such as a 4K TV or 1440p monitor**. With just a few cable connections, your PS5 video output is now being routed through the capture card and into your display as normal.
### Adjusting PS5 System Settings for Optimal Capture
Before starting gameplay capture, a couple PS5 system settings should be adjusted for optimal results. **If your capture card cannot record at 4K resolutions, it's best to change the PS5's video output resolution down to 1080p in the system settings under "Screen and Video"**. This will ensure smooth recording without compromising quality. Additionally, to allow streaming or sharing recorded content online, **HDCP protection should be disabled in the HDMI settings**. HDCP is an encrypted digital rights protection that can interfere with recording or transmitting gameplay. Once these settings are configured, your PS5 is ready for high-quality external capture.
### Installing Capture Software on Your PC
Now that the hardware is configured, you'll need software on your PC to handle the actual recording. For the Elgato HD60 S, **download and install the free Elgato Game Capture software** from their website. This provides all the necessary functions for controlling captue. **Upon launching the program, you'll need to select the Elgato HD60 S as the video capture device input source under the "Devices" tab**. This links the software with the capture card handling the incoming PS5 video signal. From here you can customize recording resolution, frame rate, and audio/mic settings to match your needs and hardware capabilities.
### Starting Gameplay Capture and Recording
When ready to start capturing gameplay, ensure the Elgato Game Capture software is launched with the capture card selected as the video source. Then fire up your desired game on the PS5. **Click the large record button in the software before starting gameplay to immediately begin recording the incoming PS5 video and audio feed**. The captured footage will automatically save to your PC in high quality. You can also click the record button at any point to start or stop recording sessions. Having everything configured ahead of time allows you to focus fully on the gameplay itself instead of fiddling with settings mid-session. Record entire playthroughs or just epic moments on the fly with ease.
### Editing and Sharing Your Recordings
After capturing awesome gameplay clips, it's time to edit and share your prowess with the world. **Import recorded gameplay footage from the capture software into video editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro**. Here you can trim clips, add transitions, overlay commentary, and utilize other editing tools. Once polished, export your finished video project. Now the real fun begins as you can **share your creation to YouTube and social media for your fans and gamers worldwide to see**. Watch those views, likes, and subscribers start rolling in as you establish yourself as a top gaming content creator directly from your PS5.
