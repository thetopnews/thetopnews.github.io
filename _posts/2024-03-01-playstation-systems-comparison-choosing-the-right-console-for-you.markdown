### A Refined Redesign with the PS4 Slim  
In 2016, Sony introduced the **PS4 Slim console**, a slimmed-down redesign of the original system.

The Slim also gained support for dual-band WiFi networks, improving online connectivity for seamless **multiplayer gaming experiences**.
## Part 2: Power and Performance with the PS4 Pro
### Enhanced Graphics and Processing with the PS4 Pro
As the premier **PlayStation system**, the PS4 Pro delivers best-in-class hardware. Released in 2016, its more powerful GPU and CPU enable stunning 4K visuals and smooth **high-resolution gameplay**.

### Leveraging Advanced Tech for Immersive Gaming  
Thanks to its upgraded internals, the PS4 Pro is ready to handle demanding titles with enhanced textures, lighting effects, and frame rates.

Whether you prefer **single-player story campaigns** or competitive online multiplayer, the Pro delivers the most life-like visual presentations.
## Part 3: Connectivity Considerations Across Systems  
### Consistent Online Functionality Across All Models
While each PlayStation system handles connectivity differently, the core online functions remain consistent. Games featuring **frequent content updates** thrive with a stable internet connection. Meanwhile, purely offline **single-player games** can still be enjoyed disc-based without downloading patches.

Faster networks like dual-band WiFi and strong bandwidth allow players to seamlessly engage in robust online features. With the optional use of ethernet, download wait times are minimized for faster access to the latest **game downloads and add-ons**. This is especially useful for massive titles regularly receiving large updates.
## Part 4: Picking the Right Console
### Choosing Between Original and Slim PS4 Models 
If unconcerned with WiFi capabilities or overall size, the original PS4 delivers full functionality at an affordable price point. Otherwise, the Slim offers a compact redesign with improved connectivity in a smaller form factor. Both allow access to all available **PlayStation games and services**.
### The Power and Performance of the PS4 Pro

### Getting the Most Value and Enjoyment Over Time  
All PlayStation systems offer countless hours of entertainment from a huge library of amazing games. However, the Pro maintains relevancy longer with its high-end components prepared to tackle graphical demands of future titles.
