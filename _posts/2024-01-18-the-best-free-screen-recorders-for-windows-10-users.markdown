### Uninstalling Existing Screen Recorders
Microsoft Windows 10 comes pre-installed with basic screen recording functionality. However, some users may have installed third-party screen recorders in the past. Before evaluating new options, it's a good idea to cleanly uninstall any existing recorders.
This part will outline the steps to safely remove the **Samsung Screen Recorder** app from your Windows 10 system. To begin, open the Start menu and click on Settings. Next, select Apps & features from the menu on the left. Scan the list of installed programs and locate Samsung Screen Recorder. Click the Uninstall button and confirm when prompted to fully remove it from your PC.

### Leveraging the Built-In Xbox Game Bar Recorder 
The Xbox Game Bar includes a basic but handy screen recording tool for Windows 10 users. While primarily aimed at gamers for capturing gameplay clips, it can also record any window or full screen on your device. 
This integrated recorder is very easy to access with a simple keyboard shortcut. However, it may cause performance issues like lag when recording resource-intensive programs or games. The built-in tool also only allows recording one application window at a time.
### Bandicam - A User Friendly Screen Recorder
**Bandicam** is one of the most popular free screen recording software options available for Windows. It works smoothly even on lower-end hardware and has intuitive controls. 
This recorder is great for capturing video tutorials, presentations, or live streaming content. You can easily record your full screen, a selected window, or a customized recording region. The audio input is also easily configurable.
The downside is Bandicam conspicuously brands all recordings with its watermark by default. While the logo can be removed with a paid license, it may not be suitable if you need watermark-free clips.
### OBS Studio - Powerful Yet Complex Recording Software  
**Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio** is an open-source, cross-platform application for video recording and live streaming. It offers much more robust and advanced editing tools compared to other simpler options.
OBS allows recording multiple audio/video sources simultaneously. You can also add transitions, overlays, and capture from webcams. The software is highly customizable and totally free. However, it comes with a steep learning curve due to its complexity. 
Unless you need advanced live streaming or editing features, OBS Studio may be overkill for basic screen recording needs. The interface can also feel overwhelming for casual users.
### ScreenRec - A Lightweight Yet Versatile Screen Recorder  
**ScreenRec** is a tiny screen recording application weighing less than 1MB in size. Despite its small footprint, it offers high quality recording without impacting your system performance.
This recorder lets you choose between recording the full screen, active window, or a customized selection area. You can also record system audio, microphone input, or both. Best of all, ScreenRec does not watermark recordings like some competitors.
The drawback is a relatively small 2GB of cloud storage included with the free version. However, you can always store clips locally or upload to other platforms once complete.
### Comparing the Main Recording Features
In summary, the Xbox Game Bar is best for casual users focused on gaming. Bandicam provides an easy experience but watermarks clips. OBS Studio offers the most control but requires learning to fully utilize. ScreenRec strikes a nice balance with its lightweight footprint and lack of restrictions.
All options are capable depending on your specific needs. Gameplay or single-app recordings favor the Game Bar. Bandicam works well for simple tutorials. But ScreenRec gives the most versatility without compromises for basic recording tasks.
### Determining the Right Recorder for You
Whether you need to capture footage for tutorials, presentations, meetings or gameplay, these free Windows recorders can handle basic tasks without issue. ScreenRec and Bandicam are great starting points for simple use due to their low system impact.
However, if avoiding watermarks in recordings is important, ScreenRec emerges as the better pick. It has no visible branding or time/space limits either. More technically proficient users may also want to learn OBS Studio over time for its advanced capabilities.
In the end, evaluate your specific recording goals and use cases and then choose the tool that best serves your needs without unnecessary overhead. All of these recorders provide free and quality options to capture your screen on Windows 10 computers.
