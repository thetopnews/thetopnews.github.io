### The Sonydirect Reserve Program  
Sony launched a pre-order program months before the PS5 launch to help gamers secure consoles. Selected users received emails to join a waitlist and reserve a PS5 bundle. I was lucky enough to receive an invite and logged in 34 minutes after receiving the email. I was able to **secure a PS5 disc edition console bundle** which included an extra controller and games. Several months later, Sony offered me another chance to purchase a second console through the program, but I declined as I already had one. The reserve links were tied to your PSN account, so the slots could not be shared with others. This exclusive program gave some lucky gamers a head start in obtaining the new console.

### Monitoring Walmart for Fair Priced Restocks
Many resellers took advantage of the console scarcity and tried to sell PS5s at inflated prices. Walmart remains one of the few major retailers still selling the PS5 near the **manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP)**. They have sporadic restocks but systems still sell out lightning fast. My advice is to check the Walmart website daily for restock updates. Set notifications for when items come back in stock. With persistence and timing, hopeful buyers may be able to add a PS5 to their cart before supplies run out again. During one surprise restock in late 2021, I added a PS5 to my cart but it got removed due to out of stock before I could checkout.   
### Watch for Midnight Restocks on Target
Like Walmart, Target also sells consoles close to MSRP. Unfortunately, they face the same issue of limited inventory that sells out in minutes. One pattern I noticed is that Target seemed to restock their online inventory around midnight Central time. This is likely timed with their inventory replenishment cycles. I would vigorously refresh the Target PS5 product page right at midnight and occasionally saw the "add to cart" button pop up for a few moments before going out of stock again. With luck and speed, some diligent gamers were able to temporarily add a console to their carts during these brief midnight restock windows.
### The Risks and Expenses of Buying on eBay
Desperate buyers turning to resellers on eBay drove console prices to outrageous levels. It was not uncommon to see listings for $1000 up to $1500 or more, sometimes double or triple the standard retail cost. While eBay provides buyer protection, there have been numerous reports of illegitimate sellers taking advantage of the hot commodity. Some buyers spent thousands and received nothing, while others received photos of a PS5 instead of the actual console. Unless you have money to burn and do not mind the premium, eBay is usually not the safest place to search for a fairly priced new PlayStation 5. Stick with authorized retailers whenever possible.
### Inquire About Waiting Lists with Local Game Shops  
As a last resort, I contacted various local videogame and electronics shops in my area to ask if they maintained any waitlists for future PS5 allotments from distributors. To my surprise, a small independent game store informed me they had a list of interested customers and would provide notification when shipments came in. After waiting patiently for 2 months, I received a call that my name was next on the list. I was able to purchase a PS5 bundle directly from this store, bypassing all the online retailer chaos. It is always worth checking with brick and mortar shops who may offer more personal purchasing opportunities for hard-to-find items.
### Follow Supply Trackers on Social Media
No one can predict restocks exactly, but dedicated Twitter accounts like @PS5StockAlerts provide helpful updates. These trackers aim to notify followers as soon as they detect that major retailers like GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy or Target have replenished their PS5 allocations. They gather restock information from various sources and relay it out quickly. Some trackers even post estimated restock dates and times based on historical patterns. Having alerts enabled from a few of these supply tracking profiles improves your chances of receiving a heads up about that rare opportunity to add a PS5 to your shopping cart before they disappear yet again. Combine these social media alerts with diligent website refreshing for the best odds.
### Never Give Up and Expand Your Options
Nearly two years after launch, the PS5 remains challenging to acquire for most buyers. Retailers receive limited console shipments that are immediately purchased by eager customers. My advice is to sign up for all membership programs and stock notifications across every storefront. Check your email, preferred retailers, and Twitter alerts religiously. Setting multiple tabs refreshing product pages also increases chances of catching that restock. While randomized luck plays a role, being proactive and persistent surely improves one's odds over time. If a PS5 is still not within reach after many months, consider the Xbox Series consoles as a possible alternative while you remain on various waitlists. As a last resort, building a capable gaming PC can satisfy any console gaming needs until the PS5 supply eventually catches up with demand.
### The Long Road Ahead
Two years after the launch of the PS5, consoles remain difficult for most gamers to get their hands on. While the situation has improved slightly compared to the initial launch window, dedicated resellers continue to snatch up stock drops within minutes. Some optimistic forecasts predict supply will stabilize in 2023. However, unprecedented global component shortages and disruptions in manufacturing and logistics create ongoing uncertainty. Those still seeking a new PlayStation 5 will need continued patience and perseverance. Check in routinely with all major retailers both online and local, stay tuned to restock Twitter alerts, and keep an eye out for retailer exclusive programs. With a mix of diligence, timing and good fortune, there is hope more supply will eventually reach eager gamers still waiting to experience the latest generation of Sony gaming.
In summary, obtaining a PlayStation 5 console has been an elusive goal for many since its launch during the pandemic. By leveraging various strategies such as the Sony direct program, following retail patterns, checking local stores and monitor social media alerts - dedicated gamers have been able to secure the in-demand system. While the situation gradually improves, consistent effort combined with a dash of luck remains key to coming out victorious in the ongoing quest to track down the coveted PS5. Stay hopeful as supply scales up in the years ahead.
