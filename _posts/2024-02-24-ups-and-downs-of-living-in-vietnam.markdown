## Part I: Morning Routine in Saigon
### **Daily commute preparation** 
Waking up at 6am each morning, I would do some light stretching and meditation by the window to watch the sunrise over Saigon. The early morning light and sounds of motorbikes starting up always helped calm my mind before the day began. For breakfast, I enjoyed making a simple meal of toast, eggs, and coffee to fuel my body. After eating, I would take a quick shower and get dressed before calling a Grab vehicle around 7:15am to begin the commute to my office downtown.

### **Daily commute by motorbike taxi**
Grab was the most efficient way to travel through Saigon's bustling traffic during rush hour. I found the best drivers were knowledgeable about back routes and shortcuts to help avoid the worst traffic jams. While navigating the busy streets, I would listen to podcasts or music to help pass the time. Some days the traffic moved smoothly, while other days it seemed stop-and-go the whole way. But overall, I felt grateful to have reliable transportation each morning.
## Part II: **Unpleasant commuting experiences** due to traffic jams 
### **Frustrations with unpredictable travel times**
One of the biggest challenges of daily life in Saigon was dealing with unpredictable traffic. It wasn't uncommon for commutes that should take 30 minutes to stretch over an hour due to traffic jams. Not knowing exactly when I would arrive at my destination caused me a lot of stress. I tried to plan generous buffer time, but there was no true accounting for when big accidents or other incidents occurred blocking major roads.
### **Coping strategies such as listening to music** 
To cope with stop-and-go traffic and long commutes, I found listening to calming music or audiobooks helped pass the time. This took my mind off the frustration of being stuck. I was also grateful my Grab drivers understood traffic was out of our control. We would chat pleasantly or enjoy the shared music, transforming what could be an irritating experience into something more bearable. Most days the extra time wasn't a huge issue, but it did add up over weeks and months of commuting.
## Part III: **Stressful but rewarding office work** 
### **Busy workdays with constantly shifting priorities**
My job in digital marketing consisted of juggling multiple projects each with tight deadlines. Some days were more hectic than others depending on client deliverables and unplanned issues that emerged. With a small team, we all wore many hats which meant priorities were often in flux. Managing competing demands was mentally draining at times.
### **Appreciating worthwhile career opportunities**  
However, I was thankful for the experience I gained and chance to develop new skills. Compared to other countries, I didn't face discrimination barriers in my career. While work had its stressful moments, I found the work fulfilling and was constantly learning. Overall, the job provided stability and opportunities to grow that I valued greatly living abroad.
## Part IV: **Unwinding activities** after a long workday
### **Relaxing at home with hobbies like reading**
To unwind after work, I enjoyed treating myself to quiet time at home with relaxing hobbies. One of my favorite activities was curling up with a good book, whether fiction or non-fiction. Losing myself in a captivating story helped shift my mind away from the day's stresses. Other low-key hobbies included cooking new recipes, journaling, or stretching.
### **Socializing with friends at local cafes and parks** 
On weekends or after work some days, I looked forward to meeting up with friends at popular cafes or parks around Saigon. It was a nice change of pace to get outside and catch up over coffee or food. We found new restaurants and activities to experience together. Social time was recharging and helped me appreciate life in the city beyond just work obligations.
## Part V: **Travel aspirations and financial realities**
### **Wishing to explore Vietnam's beautiful landscapes and cultures**  
Having lived in Saigon for a few years, I yearned to see more of Vietnam beyond the city. There were so many landscapes, historic sites, beaches and other regions I wanted to experience. Friends who had taken trips around the country posted beautiful photos that fueled my wanderlust. Travel seemed like the best way to learn about the diverse cultures and gain a broader perspective of the country.
### **Budget constraints limiting travel ambitions**
However, significant travel usually required savings I had not accumulated yet on my salary. As much as I dreamed of multi-week trips, the costs of transportation, accommodation, activities and more were a significant investment each time. Financially, I had other priorities like contributing to retirement funds and an emergency savings. While frustrating, I accepted I needed to be patient and use shorter but frequent trips within my means for now.
## Part VI: **Housing stability and financial planning assessments** 
### **Renting long-term while contemplating property ownership** 
For several years, I had rented a modest apartment in a central area of Saigon. The stability of renting was comfortable compared to unpredictable real estate markets in other global cities. However, I began thinking more about investing in a property long-term as housing prices continued rising in Vietnam. Owning would provide more stability for the future when starting a family.  
### **Researching obstacles and opportunities for homebuying** 
I evaluated factors like overall costs, mortgage requirements, average property appreciation rates and maintenance responsibilities. Getting assistance from parents could possibly shorten the timeline, but I aimed to be financially independent. Overall it seemed achievable within 5-7 years if I maintained disciplined savings habits and took advantage of any bonuses at work. The research helped refine my financial goals.
## Part VII: **Daily commute exertion** 
### **Strenuous bike commute and stair climbing**  
While grateful to live relatively close to work, my daily commute involved riding my bike approximately 2 miles each way including some steep climbs. Then at the office, I had to walk up 5 long flights of stairs to reach my floor since elevators were often broken. All this physical exertion added up, leaving me feeling sweaty and out of breath by the time I arrived at my desk.  
### **Concerns about body odor and lack of shower access**  
Not having a chance to shower before meetings or client calls was less than ideal. I worried about how I smelled after the ride and climb. Carrying extra deodorant and clothing helped somewhat but wasn't a complete solution. The small hassle brought self-consciousness to an otherwise enjoyable exercise routine. Finding alternate commute options on particularly hot and humid days would improve my daily experience.
## Part VIII: **Reflecting on relationship compatibility** 
### **Reassessing relationship during personal growth period abroad**  
Living overseas naturally led to self-reflection about life goals and priorities. As my career progressed and independence grew, I found myself thinking critically about my long-term relationship. While loving in many ways, being apart from family and past friends highlighted areas my partner and I no longer fully connected. Our core values seemed less aligned compared to earlier years together. 
### **Lessons from previous international experiences**
Relationships tested during periods abroad either strengthened or revealed underlying issues, based on lessons from a past travel stint. Spending extended time culturally immersed highlighted aspects needing work or were simply incompatible long-run. Though difficult, honestly confronting compatibility doubts was healthier than ignoring problems. A decision loomed whether to commit fully again or consider alternative paths.
## Part IX: **Living with contradictions** 
### **Appreciating lifestyle amidst wider societal challenges**
Overall my life in Vietnam balanced positives with inevitable difficulties. I appreciated stable work, affordable cost of living and warm community. However, systemic issues like corruption, censorship and human rights concerns marred wider societal progress. While grateful for privileges as a foreigner, I wished for greater freedoms and justice universally available.  
### **Making the most of present while planning next steps** 
Reflecting, I aimed living intentionally present yet forward-thinking. Each day, I found purpose through work, relationships and personal growth. Simultaneously, private financial planning and career networking helped strategize my next chapter, whether remaining long-term in Vietnam or elsewhere. With patience and resilience, I was determined making the most of this life stage regardless external obstacles or inner doubts.
