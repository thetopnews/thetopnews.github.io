### Safely Re-downloading Your Games 
As a Nintendo Switch owner, you want to make sure you're able to access your digital game library whenever and wherever you want to play. Fortunately, the Nintendo eShop allows you to easily **re-download games you've previously purchased** to your Nintendo account at no extra cost. As long as a paid title has not been delisted or removed from the online storefront, you can re-download it to your Switch or other supported devices anytime you want to play again. 
While your digital games are linked to your Nintendo profile, **you cannot share downloaded titles across multiple Switch systems or friend's accounts**. Each user must purchase their own copy to access a game on their own system. However, you are free to play any games downloaded by other profiles on the same Switch using a secondary user. Just be aware that **save data does not carry over between user profiles**, so you'll need to restart any progress made in a downloaded title.

### Creating a Nintendo Account for Game Access
To lawfully acquire and play digital games on the Nintendo Switch, you first need to create a free Nintendo account. This profile links to your chosen eShop region and payment methods to enable game **purchases, downloads and cloud saves**. Without a registered account, you have no legitimate way to obtain Nintendo Switch titles through the official online storefront. 
Setting up a Nintendo profile takes just a few minutes. Simply provide your email, date of birth and choose a username/password during setup. With your account created, you now have access to browse and purchase games from the Nintendo eShop. Best of all, your digital purchases are tied to your account rather than the physical console - so you can redownload games on any compatible device linked to your profile.
### Browsing and Downloading from the Nintendo eShop
The Nintendo eShop serves as the digital marketplace for Switch, Wii U, 3DS and more. With your newly created Nintendo account linked, you can easily browse thousands of available games sorted by various categories like "New Releases", "Best Sellers" and specific genres. 
While some free-to-play and demo titles are available, the bulk of content on the eShop consists of **premium paid games**. Purchasing these digitally is simple - just add the game to your cart, select your preferred payment method and confirm to immediately start the download process. Given the Switch's portable nature, **having your game library accessible anytime through digital purchases** provides unrivaled convenience compared to physical game cards.
### Playing Free-to-Play and Demo Games
Not every game on the Nintendo eShop requires an upfront payment. A small selection of popular free-to-play titles like Fortnite can be downloaded at no cost, granting full access to their core multiplayer experiences. These games monetize through optional cosmetic microtransactions instead of a box price.
Demo versions of premium games also exist on the eShop for you to try before buying. Demos allow sampling a game for a limited time with restrictions on levels/progression. This lets you experience part of the title to help decide if the **full game is worth purchasing**. Demos are a risk-free way to discover potential new favorite games.
### Staying Clear of Piracy with Homebrew Alternatives  
While altering or jailbreaking the Switch is understandably tempting, **Nintendo actively bans consoles used for piracy or other unauthorized activities**. To keep your system usable online and able to access the eShop long-term, avoid downloading pirated game files or installing custom firmware altogether.
Some homebrew communities create **legal free games and emulators that do not enable piracy** through custom distribution channels instead of piracy sites. However, homebrew software still requires hacking your Switch which risks a ban. For a risk-free experience, it's generally best to limit Switch gaming to only officially distributed storefront content. Stick with **premium paid games, free-to-play titles and official demo versions available on the Nintendo eShop**.
### Safely Storing Your Digital Library in the Cloud  
Nintendo's online services protect your digital games through **cloud saves stored on their servers**. This allows recovering your save data if your system is lost, stolen or needs reformatting by redownloading to a new Switch. 
As long as your Nintendo account remains in good standing without restrictions, you can rest easy knowing your game progress is securely backed up. Just be sure to occasionally sync your saves to the cloud using the settings menu. This offers vital peace of mind for your invested digital library compared to only physical cartridges vulnerable to damage.
### Conclusion
By creating a Nintendo account, browsing legitimate storefronts like the Nintendo eShop, and avoiding unauthorized file distribution - you can safely access the full library of Switch games digitally without risk of bans or legal issues. Stick to premium paid downloads, free demos, updated homebrew or just physical editions for a simple, secure gaming experience on Nintendo's hybrid portable system for years to come.
