##Introduction
The PlayStation VR is designed primarily for the PS4 and PS5 consoles. However, it is possible to play PC games on the PlayStation VR headset through additional hardware and software. In this article, I will share my experiences playing various PC games on the PlayStation VR through different methods like **Remote Play**, **Virtual Desktop**, and **Trinus VR**. I will discuss the gaming experiences, what games caused **motion sickness** and which were more tolerable. Also, my favorite games played and settings preferences will be outlined. The benefits and drawbacks of streaming PC games to the headset will be examined along with recommendations based on my learnings. 
### Comfortably Streaming PC Games to PlayStation VR
There are a few options available to stream PC games to the PlayStation VR headset requiring a high-performance gaming PC and high-speed internet connection. **Remote Play** allows streaming select PS4 games from the console to VR. **Virtual Desktop** and **Trinus VR** can stream SteamVR and non-VR PC games but need a graphics card that supports **VR stream encoding**. While **PlayStation Now** subscription streams select PC titles, the service availability is limited to certain regions. The experience depends on hardware compatibility and internet speeds affecting streaming quality and **input latency**.

### Gaming at My Leisure in Virtual Environments
Streaming provided the benefit of playing games in new comfortable positions like lying on the couch, something traditional PC gaming doesn't offer. With the big virtual displays, I could enjoy games in an immersive **cinematic experience**. While the headset screen didn't move with my head turns, it was still fun using just a controller. Streaming allowed gaming from anywhere in the house rather than being confined to a desk. However, the stationary display and motion limitations impacted the experience versus native VR.
### Consistent Visuals Help Mitigate Motion Sickness 
Most streamed games caused terrible headaches and nausea within minutes. But **Driveclub VR** and **Wipeout** using cockpit views were exceptions, allowing hour-long gameplay sessions due to consistent stationary visuals. The simple, consistent visuals meant for VR and cockpit views made **Wipeout** one of my favorites despite craving full motion controls. **Driveclub VR's** cockpit view was also preferred but I wished to turn my head freely with the screen.
### Finding the Right Balance for Different Game Types
**Megadimension Neptunia VIIR** incorporated occasional VR sessions into normal gameplay, providing much-needed breaks in between using the headset. This alternating approach became my favorite as it balanced immersion with reducing **motion sickness**. While gimmicky VR games weren't compelling, periodic brief VR within a normal title struck the right balance. Consistent rest breaks were important when prone to motion sickness from VR gaming.
### Room for Enhancements Across Platforms and Accessibility
While workarounds exist to play PC games, full compatibility is limited by hardware, software and connection speeds. More first-party support across platforms could significantly improve the experience. Accessibility and options for those prone to motion sickness still needs progress. The technology is promising but room for enhancements remain in areas like **motion controls**, **cross-platform integration** and **accessibility features**.
In summary, games optimized explicitly for VR with consistent steady visuals and optional cockpit views produce the best results. Periodic scheduled interruptions in solely VR games also help compared to solely gimmicky VR titles. Appropriate rest breaks are vital, especially for those prone to motion sickness. Streaming provides an alternative when using native hardware isn't possible, but demands high-performing equipment and fast, reliable internet connections. Consistently improving the overall experience across platforms remains an ongoing effort.
