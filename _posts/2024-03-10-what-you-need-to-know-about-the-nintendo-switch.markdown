## Part 1: Creating a Free Nintendo Account
### **Establishing a Link to Digital Games and Services with a Nintendo Account**
Creating a free Nintendo account is one of the first steps any new Nintendo Switch owner should take. A Nintendo account allows you to access the Nintendo eShop to browse, download, and purchase digital games and applications. It will also link your profile and purchases to your Nintendo Switch and other devices. With a Nintendo account, you can browse and immediately download free-to-play games like  **Fortnite Battle Royale** and **Paladins Champions of the Realm** from the vast library in the Nintendo eShop. Establishing this account only takes a few minutes and is necessary to unlock the digital content available for the Nintendo Switch.

## Part 2: Browsing and Downloading Games from the Nintendo eShop
### **Exploring New Titles and Generes with Free Game Demos and Trials**  
The Nintendo eShop offers users an incredible selection of games spanning every imaginable genera. In addition established classics and blockbuster titles, there are many unique indie games and hidden gems. One of the best ways to discover new favorites is by taking advantage of the free demos and trials available. Game demos allow users to sample the first part of a game or include a limited mode, giving them a taste before committing to a purchase. This is highly recommended for  **downloading indie games and unfamiliar IPs** to determine if the gameplay style and story are engaging. Demos eliminate the risk of wasting money and help ensure only games a user knows they will enjoy end up in their library.
## Part 3: Accessing Classic NES Games with Nintendo Switch Online
### **Subscribing to Unlock Additional Features Like Online Play and a Growing Collection of 8-bit Titles**  
While the Nintendo Switch provides hundreds of modern titles right out of the box, subscribing to Nintendo Switch Online unlocks additional legacy content and functionality. One major perk is access to classic 8-bit NES games through an included Nintendo Switch Online app. With an active individual membership priced affordably at $19.99 per year, users can play and re-live titles from the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The library includes fan favorites like **The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Metroid,** and **Mega Man** with more added regularly. Nintendo Switch Online is also required for online multiplayer in paid games. The low-cost subscription provides value for both retro gaming nostalgia and modern online play.
## Part 4: Subscription Not Needed for Free Digital Offers  
### **Downloading and Playing Free Content Without Spending Extra on Memberships**
While Nintendo Switch Online provides extra value with classic games and online multiplayer, it's important to note the subscription is not required simply to access any digital content on the Nintendo Switch. All games, apps, and demo downloads from the Nintendo eShop are free and playable without a membership. This includes free-to-play titles and free demo versions of games. Users can enjoy a wide variety of quality games without spending the additional $20 for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. For those on a strict budget or just starting their library, the generous selection of free software ensures there's always something new to discover and play without any added recurring fees.
## Part 5: Understanding the Distinctions Between Accounts, Services, and Stores
### **Keeping Track of Nintendo's Digital Infrastructure for Games, Profiles, and Extra Features**  
When first exploring the digital side of the Nintendo Switch, it can be easy to get confused between the different online components involved. The Nintendo eShop acts as the virtual storefront for browsing, purchasing, and downloading games and applications. However, having a Nintendo account is required separately to sign into the eShop and devices to link purchases and profile data. On top of that, paying for Nintendo Switch Online grants access to additional online modes and services beyond just the eShop. It's important for users to understand the distinctions between these pieces - the free eShop, separate free Nintendo account, and optional paid Nintendo Switch Online membership - to maximize their experiences while avoiding unnecessary spending.
## Part 6: Plenty of Entertainment Options Without Breaking the Bank
### **Enjoying Quality Games Through Various Budget-friendly Methods**
One of the great aspects of the Nintendo Switch is that users do not need to spend beyond the base system costs right away to begin experiencing quality games. In the first few weeks or months of ownership, there are numerous free, trial, and low-cost options available to tide over players. Between the permanent free games like **Fortnite and Paladins,** timed-limited free game demos of all genres, and inexpensive indie downloads, users can build up a thriving game library. This allows them to evaluate what styles they most enjoy before committing larger sums to bigger retail releases down the road. With careful selection from the eShop, Nintendo Switch owners need not feel pressed into an online subscription or new releases until they've fully explored affordable options. Overall, the system provides budget-friendly paths to endless entertainment.
