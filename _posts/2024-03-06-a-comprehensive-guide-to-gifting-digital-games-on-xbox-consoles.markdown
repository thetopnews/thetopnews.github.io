## Introduction
Gifting digital games to friends and family who enjoy gaming is a thoughtful way to show you care, but **directly gifting downloadable Xbox games** is not readily supported through the Xbox platform. However, Xbox owners have developed some creative workarounds that allow sharing the digital gaming experience even when the recipient is not nearby to receive a physical disc. This guide will outline the various options for purchasing and sending downloadable games as gifts on Xbox consoles.
### Navigating Licensing Limitations  
Microsoft's regional licensing for digital content prevents directly transferring purchases between accounts and marketplaces. While this makes business sense for the company, it creates obstacles for digital gifting across borders or regions. As gaming brings people together worldwide, some more**flexibility in cross-region gifting licenses**would enhance the shared experience. For now, alternative gifting methods must be employed.

## Purchasing Games for Gift Delivery
The gifting processes differ slightly between Xbox 360 and Xbox One platforms, but both involve purchasing the digital content separately before sending it to the recipient. For **Xbox 360 games as gifts**, only physical discs can be shipped unless game codes are used. **Xbox One** offers a "Buy as Gift" option online to purchase games through theMicrosoft Storefor directdeliveryto anothergamertag.
### SendingGiftsfromtheXboxOneMarketplace
Fortunately, the Xbox One gamertag gifting process is fairly straightforward. Navigate to the game’s product page in the Microsoft Store on Xbox One. Select “Buy as Gift” and sign into the associated Microsoft account if needed. Enter the recipient’s gamertag and include a personalized message if desired. The game will be tied to their account and ready for download once redeemed. Just be sure the gift recipient has an Xbox One console or Windows 10 PC to redeem and play their new digital title.
### BuyingGameCodesfromRetailers
An alternative that works for both Xbox 360 and Xbox One is purchasing digital game codes **from major retailers**. Sites like Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and more sell codes redeemable on either console. This allows gifting the gamelicensewithoutshipping discs. When the code arrives by email, just forward it along to the lucky gamer so they can activate it on their Xbox. Some merchants may even give gift wrapping or cards as nice extrasfor the occasion. Overall, gamecodes offer easy cross-platform gifting.
