### Introduction
Connecting physical gaming controllers to smartphones and tablets opens up new possibilities for mobile gaming. With the right accessory and software support, players can enjoy an expanded level of control similar to console experiences. One popular option is using Xbox 360 controllers, thanks to their widespread compatibility. However, not all controllers and Android devices pair seamlessly. This guide provides a thorough overview of setting up both wired and wireless Xbox 360 controllers on Android, along with testing across different games and emulators.

### Wired Connection Overview  
The easiest way to connect an original Xbox 360 controller to an Android device is with a wired USB connection. Players will need an **OTG (On-The-Go) cable** equipped with either a micro USB or USB-C connector on one end and a standard USB plug on the other. This allows the smartphone or tablet to act as a USB host for the controller. Once the OTG cable is plugged into the Android device and the controller is connected via the other end, the system should automatically recognize the input hardware. No additional drivers or apps are typically required for a basic wired setup.
### Connecting a Wired Xbox 360 Controller
To connect a wired Xbox 360 controller:
1. Ensure the Android device and controller are fully charged. Low battery levels can cause recognition issues.
2. Plug the micro USB or USB-C end of an OTG cable into the smartphone or tablet. 
3. Attach the standard USB end of the cable to the Xbox 360 controller.
4. The device should promptly detect the new input device. A notification may pop up or it may simply be ready for use in supported apps and games.
5. Test button functionality by navigating menus, playing compatible games, or using emulators. Troubleshoot if any buttons do not work as expected.
### Wireless Connectivity Requirements
While convenient, using a wired connection limits play range and comfort. The Xbox 360 controller can also operate wirelessly by pairing with Microsoft's official wireless receiver dongle. However, this adds an extra pairing step and the dongle must be connected to the Android device via OTG cable as there is no internal Bluetooth support. Players will need:
1. A wireless Xbox 360 controller 
2. Microsoft's Xbox 360 wireless gaming receiver
3. An OTG cable to connect the receiver to their smartphone or tablet
### Pairing a Wireless Xbox 360 Controller
To pair a wireless Xbox 360 controller:
1. Connect the wireless receiver to the Android device using an OTG cable.
2. Push and hold the synchronize button on the back of the wireless controller. The guide button should start rapidly flashing.
3. Press and release the synchronize button on the wireless receiver. Its LED should turn solid when pairing is complete. 
4. The controller is now paired and can be used up to 15 feet away from the receiver/Android device.
5. Test inputs as with a wired connection. Repeat pairing if issues occur.
### Game and Emulator Compatibility 
While Xbox 360 controllers are recognized at the system-level, game support varies greatly. Some Android titles enable custom input mapping and work flawlessly with 360 pads out of the box. However, other games may only support touch or require manual mapping of unfamiliar button layouts. Emulators generally offer remapping but performance is dependent on the specific software and hardware. Players should research titles beforehand or experiment to determine functionality. Issues may also stem from deadzones, d-pad recognition, or camera control in three dimensional games. Regular testing across different software helps identify compatibility strengths and weaknesses.
### Alternative Controller Options
For gamers encountering problems, other popular brands can provide reliable wireless Android support. The Xbox One controller connects seamlessly to phones and tablets via built-in Bluetooth. No additional accessories are needed for pairing after enabling the function in Bluetooth settings. Nintendo Switch Pro controllers also use Bluetooth for a plug-and-play experience. DualShock 4 gamepads from PlayStation need the DS4Windows app and Bluetooth to function properly. While setup varies, these modern controllers circumvent compatibility concerns of older Xbox 360 controllers by communicating directly with mobile devices.
### Testing on Android TV Box
To gain further insight, an original **Xbox 360 controller was tested on an Android TV box running version 7.1**. This scenario brings the setup closer to a living room console experience. While button presses and right stick movement were recognized, issues arose with excess deadzone on right stick angle detection. Navigation worked perfectly in emulators just needing d-pad input. However, three dimensional camera-based games proved unplayable due to right stick inconsistencies. This reveals even wired 360 pads face recognition problems depending on targeted software and hardware. Regular firmware updates may eventually resolve some compatibility problems.
### Potential Workarounds
A few options exist when Xbox 360 controllers exhibit connectivity or control issues on Android:
- Try an alternative Bluetooth controller like Xbox One or Switch Pro to determine if the problem persists across input devices 
- Search online community forums and support pages for specific workarounds related to the game or emulator in use
- Check for software updates to the mobile device, game, or emulator which may have addressed previous bugs 
- Test with a different Android phone, tablet or TV box as varying hardware can affect wireless connectivity and controller support
- As a last resort, use virtual button mapping within apps as a substitute for direct controller inputs
While not foolproof, these strategies can help isolate whether issues stem from the controller, targeted software, or Android hardware itself. With experimentation, playable setups are achievable even if they require extra configuration effort.
### Conclusion
In summary, Xbox 360 controllers provide expansive Android compatibility thanks to their widespread adoption. However, both technical limitations and inconsistent support across games mean they may not be ideal for all mobile gameplay scenarios. Wired connections perform better than wireless but reduce range of motion. Bluetooth controllers avoid pairing steps but compatibility depends on specific models. Overall, individual testing remains necessary due to the variables of software, hardware, and controller types. With some tinkering, authentic console-style control can be realized on smartphones and tablets for many, though mobile touch controls remain an easy fallback.
