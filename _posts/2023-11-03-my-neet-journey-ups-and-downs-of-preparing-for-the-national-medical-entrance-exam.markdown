Studying for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is no joke. As one of the most competitive medical entrance exams in India, NEET requires extensive preparation over multiple years to stand a chance at securing admission to an MBBS program. In this article, I share my personal experience giving the exam thrice and the rollercoaster of emotions involved in this process. Read on for insights into the pressures of NEET preparation and my successes and failures along the way.
## Focusing on the Road Ahead
When I first decided to take the NEET exam, I was aware of the monumental task ahead of me. With over 1.5 million applicants vying for fewer than 100,000 seats each year, I knew I needed total commitment to stand out. In my home state of Tripura, top **NEET coaching** options weren't readily available, so I relied on private tutoring alongside my schoolwork. The pandemic helped save me from this hectic schedule as classes moved online. Though more distraction-prone, the new format allowed flexibility that paid off.  
## Steady Progress in My Initial Attempts  
My first NEET attempt in 2020 saw me score 545 marks. While not in the top percentiles, I took this as experience to build upon. In 2021, focused practice through quality **NEET preparatory material** led to an improved 569. Taking dedicated mocks and subject tests systematically helped address weaker areas. Though online practice couldn't replace on-ground simulations fully, it gave structure during uncertain times. Step-by-step enhancements prepared me well for my final shot.
## Biological Blunder Derails Dreams
For some, a single exam determines their future. That pressure was all too real during my NEET 2021 sitting. Physics and chemistry went smoothly, scoring near-perfect 180s. But out of nowhere, my **biology revision** deserted me on crucial questions. Ending with just 496/720, dreams of a good college scattered. The irony of excelling where it mattered least made it hard to accept. A caring support system helped lift me from that low.
## Closing in on My Goal 
Refusing to stay down, I enrolled for an intensive NEET 2022 preparation program. Joining reputed test series gave rigorous practice under exam conditions. Consistently performing well raised my confidence, as subject mastery improved. In key mocks, averaging **720/720 full syllabus scores** showed I was on the right track. With single-minded focus and experience, I was determined not to falter again. 
## Exam Success and Beyond
All that preparation paid off when I secured AIR 10846 in NEET 2022 with my highest marks of 625. Relieved and proud, I can finally look forward to my MBBS journey. For aspirants out there, don't lose heart during setbacks. Stay focused on the goal and learn from mistakes. With hard work and perseverance, achieving your dream is very much possible. I hope my story motivates others to never give up.
## Choosing the Right College 
Now that I've cleared NEET, selecting a suitable medical college is important for building my career foundation. Based on my score of 625, I have a few **UP state MBBS college options**. Top choices would be King George's Medical University in Lucknow and Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College in Moradabad. Both have reputed infrastructure and faculty for quality education. Considering factors like **college reputation, placement record, and hostel facilities**, these seem ideal fits. I will review the application and admission processes closely to make informed decisions.
## Gratitude for Supportive Circles  
Reflecting on my NEET journey, I'm deeply thankful to all who stood by me. Family provided emotional strength during lows. Teachers went above and beyond, even spending vacations guiding me. Friends ensured I didn't isolate myself in studies. Online communities gave much-needed motivation. Coaches expertly groomed subject mastery. And within myself, I found the resilience to persevere till the end. With such beloved support circles, any goal is attainable. I look forward to making everyone proud in medical college!
## Valuable Life Lessons  
The highs and lows of NEET preparation instilled valuable life mantras. Never give up, however grim the situation may seem. Learn from mistakes to constantly improve. Stay dedicated to your dreams regardless of temporary setbacks. And remember that strong support systems alleviate any burden. As I embark on my medical career journey, such lessons will guide me through future challenges as well. I hope sharing my story inspires other aspirants to never lose hope and work hard towards their goals.
