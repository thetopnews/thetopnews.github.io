### **Take Advantage of Deals and Discounts on Games and Accessories**  
As the PS5 looms on the horizon, retailers are slashing prices on PS4 games, consoles, and peripherals to clear out stock. Gamers can find games like The **Last of Us Remastered** and **Persona 5** for less than $20 used. Top-tier exclusives like Spider-Man and Bloodborne regularly go on sale digitally for 50% off as well. Accessories like headsets, Charging docks, and extra controllers are also cheaper than what will be available initially for PS5. Why wait to start your backlog when savings are available now?
### **Avoid the Annoyances of a New Console Launch**
New hardware releases are rarely without problems or shortages. The PS5 launch has already been plagued by **scalper bots buying stock** only to resell consoles at exorbitant prices. Any initial PS5 models may also have **hardware faults and overheating issues** that takes Sony time to address. Opting for a mature PS4 allows gamers to sidestep these headaches while the install base and software library expands on PS5. 
## The PS4 Library and Value Proposition Remain Unmatched
### **Backwards Compatibility with Past Generations**  
While PS5 aims to play "99% of PS4 games", the ability to also enjoy PS1, PS2, and PS3 classics through PlayStation Now or integrated backwards compatibility is a huge advantage of the PS4. The **entire legacy of PlayStation franchises** like Twisted Metal, Gran Turismo, God of War, and Jak & Daxter remain fully accessible on one system. 
### **Extensive PlayStation VR Catalog**
For those interested in virtual reality gaming, the PSVR exclusive library of over 180 supported games simply can't be ignored. Titles like **Resident Evil 7, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Blood & Truth** deliver incredible immersive experiences you won't find elsewhere at this price point. With no PS5-ready PSVR headset yet announced, the PS4 remains the only budget-friendly gateway to VR gaming.
### **Unmatched Game Library Depth**  
While PS5 may deliver cutting-edge new games, the PS4 offers the deepest selection of quality titles to play through. With a 7+ year head start, **over 4,000** games have launched on the system with new indies, ports, and smaller projects still arriving regularly. That immense back-catalog ensures the PS4 will remain an entertainment powerhouse for many gamers even after newer consoles arrive. 
## Patience is a Virtue When it Comes to New Console Adoption
### **Hardware Revisions Address Design Flaws**  
All consoles launch with hiccups that initially sold systems may experience. Revisions to PS3 and Xbox 360 reduced overheating issues, for example. By waiting a year, early adopters help identify PS5 problems Sony can fix in **thermal design changes or quieter fans.** Gamers benefit from a more refined experience down the line.
### **Software Maturity Comes with Time**
No console is at its best without years of firmware updates and optimizations. PS4 software today runs far smoother than at launch, with bugfixes, improved apps, and features like **boost mode for older games**. Allowing Sony time to refine the PS5 experience results in a more full-featured machine overall.
### **Prices Drop While Libraries Grow**
Just one year after a new console arrives, prices often decrease by $100 while special bundles emerge. Meanwhile, the game selection increases exponentially. The **full power and value of each new generation** is best experienced after the initial wave when all aspects have had time to develop fully. 
## In Summary: The PS4 Remains a Smart Purchase
While next-gen excitement runs high, reality is that the PS4 journey has miles left to run. Its proven library, wealth of incredible games, and steady firmware improvements make it a safe recommendation even today. Those considering an upgrade would benefit greatly from patience and allowing Sony time to refine the PS5 experience. The PS4 deserves its place as a premier gaming platform for countless more hours of entertainment.
