### Preparing Your Media Drive
The first step is to prepare your flash drive or external hard drive to store and play your media files on your PS5. You'll want to **format your USB storage device to either exFAT or FAT32** as these are the only supported file systems. Once formatted, create a folder named "Movies" or "Videos" to help organize your files. Then you can begin transferring your video collection to this folder. Be sure to use file names that are short and clearly describe the content to make browsing easier later. You'll want at least **2GB of free space per hour of video** to ensure smooth playback without interruptions.

### Connecting Your Media Drive to PlayStation 5
Once your media drive is prepared, connecting it to your PS5 is simple. The PS5 features **SuperSpeed USB 3.2 Gen 1 (USB 3.0)** ports for fast data transfer speeds. Locate one of the USB Type-A ports on your console, either in the front or back, and securely insert your media drive. The PS5 will automatically detect the drive and you can now access your stored media files. No drivers or setup are needed, just plug and play functionality. 
### Browsing Your Library with Media Gallery
Now it's time to start enjoying your personal media collection on the big screen. Launch the built-in Media Gallery application from the PS5 home screen. This allows for enjoying stored photos, videos and music from a single integrated hub. Select "USB Storage" from the left sidebar to view the contents of your connected media drive. Easily browse through your organized folder structure to locate a video you wish to watch. With a few clicks, you can begin streaming or downloading your chosen movie or show directly to your PS5.
### Supported Video Formats on PlayStation 5
The PS5 is able to natively play common video file types without any additional software or transcoding needed. Formats such as **MP4, MKV and WEBM with H.264/AVC, VP9 and AAC/MP3 codecs** are well supported for High Definition quality playback. You can enjoy up to stunning 4K resolution of 3840x2160p at your leisure. Just be sure your video quality doesn't exceed this maximum supported resolution to avoid issues. The PS5 can smoothly handle full HD 1080p content and lower with ease from USB.
### Streaming Online Media Services  
In addition to local media storage, you have options for streaming content directly from popular online services. Apps for services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu and more can be downloaded from the PS5 media store. Once installed, you just need your account credentials to start streaming shows, movies, live TV and more in up to 4K HDR quality. Check what dedicated apps are available for all your favorite media subscriptions anddigital video libraries.
### Transferring PS4 Saved Games to PlayStation 5
One handy feature of the PS5 is the ability to easily transfer your PS4 game saves to the new console for continued progress. With a USB drive plugged in, navigate to Settings then Saved Data Management. Here you can select your USB storage and copy saves from supported PS4 titles to your PS5 internal storage with just a few clicks. Now jump back into your favorite games and resume right where you left off from your PS4.
