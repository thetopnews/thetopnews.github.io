### **Super Mario Bros Available on Nintendo Switch Online**
One of the most popular and influential games included in the NES library is Super Mario Bros. Released in 1985, Super Mario Bros helped define the platformer genre and propelled Nintendo to industry dominance during the 8-bit era. Over 30 years later, the classic sidescrolling adventure remains beloved by both longtime fans and a new generation discovering it for the first time. 
With a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, gamers can download the dedicated NES app and instantly gain access to play Super Mario Bros on their Switch. They can take on Bowser and rescue Princess Peach whether commuting to work, relaxing at home, or engaging in friendly **retro multiplayer mayhem** with others online. This provides an affordable and official way to experience one of the most influential games ever directly on the latest Nintendo hardware.
## Part 2 - Buying Super Mario Bros Digitally from the Nintendo eShop
### **Purchasing Super Mario Bros Individually from the Nintendo eShop** 
For those who don't want to commit to a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, Super Mario Bros can also be purchased individually from the Nintendo eShop storefront. At only $4.99, it remains an affordable title even three decades after its original release. 
Once bought, the digital copy is tied to the user's Nintendo Account. This allows gamers to redownload it any time from the eShop across any supported Nintendo systems, like the Switch. They gain full ownership of the classic with no restriction of an expiring subscription. 
### **Defining the Side-Scrolling Platformer Genre**
Releasing in 1985, Super Mario Bros helped popularize the side-scrolling platformer genre and was a system seller for the Nintendo Entertainment System during a pivotal time in the industry. It defined conventions still used today like collecting power-ups, defeating bosses, and rescuing a princess.
Over 40 million copies of the original Super Mario Bros have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games ever made. Nearly 35 years later, its tight controls, carefully designed levels, and **endless nostalgic charm** ensure it remains highly replayable for both retro fans and newcomers alike. Purchasing this defining classic digitally on the Switch provides the perfect way to experience gaming history.
## Part 3 - Upcoming New Mario Games and Remasters Coming to Nintendo Switch
### **Paper Mario: The Origami King Arrives This Summer** 
On July 17th, 2020, Paper Mario: The Origami King will launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch. As the latest entry in the turn-based RPG Paper Mario series, it continues the story-driven adventures of Mario and friends in a papercraft world. 
The Origami King features a revamped ring-based battle system where Mario must align enemies before attacking. It also builds upon the papercraft aesthetic the franchise is known for with unique modes of traversal like folding structures. Fans can expect charming storytelling, puzzle-solving environmental challenges, and memorable characters that have defined the Paper Mario RPG experience. 
### **Rumors of Classic 3D Mario Remasters**
Alongside new entries, rumors persist that Nintendo is working on remasters or collections of beloved 3D Mario games from the Nintendo 64, GameCube and Wii console eras for release on Switch. Titles like Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy are cited as prime candidates for high-definition re-releases or compilation packages. 
Such remasters could help fill out Nintendo's release schedule in 2020 and further expand the library of classic Mario experiences available on their hybrid console. This would allow new generations to experience the 3D Mario games that defined their original systems in brilliant high-definition while providing a nostalgic thrill for veterans of the franchises' early 3D forays. Only time will tell if these long-discussed remasters will become a reality.
## Part 4 - Mario Sells Systems Late in Their Life Cycles
### **Mario Drives Hardware Sales as Systems Age**
As Nintendo hardware enters its later life cycle years, the company relies on established franchises like Super Mario to continued moving systems off shelves. Standalone releases and compilations of classic Mario games from a console's past historically perform very well both critically and commercially near the end of a system's lifespan.
This proven business model was seen with titles like New Super Mario Bros. U and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Wii U and Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Switch. These helped extend sales momentum and gave fans beloved experiences in the waning years. Expecting more of the same treatment for Mario as Switch ages ensures his games remain a system seller well after launch.
### **Collection and Ports Drive Hardware Attach Rates** 
Beyond sales dollars, major Mario releases late in a console's life also drive higher accessory and software attach rates. Fans who purchase a system for a new Mario collection will likely also pick up extra Joy-Con controllers, cases, and other compatible games from Nintendo's robust first-party library. 
This compound effect helps support the platform's player community and makes the investment in producing classic Mario titles on modern hardware highly profitable long after launch window. Their popularity practically guarantees crossover interest from both dedicated fans and casual players.
## Part 5 - Continued Strong Support from Mario as Switch's Library Matures
### **Mario as Nintendo's Flagship Franchise**
As Nintendo's iconic mascot and one of their highest grossing intellectual properties, Super Mario receives significant support across the company. With over 800 million units of Mario games sold cumulatively worldwide, his ubiquitous presence moves both hardware and software.
Nintendo has strong incentive to leverage Mario in any way that expands the Switch's offerings as its library grows in size and maturity. From full sequels and remasters to smaller indie-style experiences, expect Mario's presence on the console to only increase over the second half of its lifespan and beyond.
### **Smaller Mario Titles Fill Release Schedules** 
Between major numbered Mario entries, the company relies on smaller experimental or collection-based releases. Recent examples include projects like Super Mario Run on mobile or the 3D All-Stars compilation. 
Titles of this scale fill slots in Nintendo's release planning while still satisfying fans. They provide lower risk, lower budget ways to keep Mario games evergreen and bridge gaps for high profile sequels' development. His broad appeal guarantees interest across all genres and budgets.
## Part 6 - Looking Ahead to More Mario on Nintendo Switch 
### **Longevity Through Experimentation**
By continually experimenting with new styles and genres, Nintendo extends Mario's legacy across multiple system generations. Upcoming titles like Origami King diversify gameplay while honoring established lore. 
In the same fashion, unique indies on the eShop like Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and SUPER MARIO RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars helped define Mario RPGs and spinoffs. Their creative successes encourage experimentation that expands Mario's evergreen appeal.
### **More Mario Assured as Switch Install Base Grows**  
With over 60 million Switch units sold to date, Nintendo has a massive install base ripe for software sales. As long as momentum continues, more mainstream and experimental Mario games can be expected down the pipeline. Whether ports, indies or all-new adventures, his presence remains an assured system seller for Switch's twilight years.
With dedication to preserve past glories like 3D All-Stars while innovating new directions, Mario's legendary journey is far from over. As Switch approaches its midpoint, fans can feel confident more creative visions for the iconic plumber remain on the way.
## Part 7 - Conclusion
Super Mario Bros. defined the side-scrolling platformer genre upon its 1985 launch and remains one of the most significant and best-selling video games ever made. Its **tight controls and finely-tuned level design** ensure endless replayability decades later. 
Through means like the Nintendo Switch Online service or direct digital purchases, gamers on Nintendo's latest console can easily access this iconic classic to experience where it all began. Meanwhile, promising new entries like Paper Mario: The Origami King and rumored remasters of Mario's acclaimed 3D outings offer nostalgia and novelty alike.
Given Mario's central role in Nintendo's identity and commercial success, his presence on Switch will only continue growing through both mainline entries and experimental offerings. As the install base matures, look for Mario's steadfast support to further extend the lifespan and passion for Nintendo's hybrid platform. Wherever gaming goes next, Mario's legendary journey shows no signs of slowing.
