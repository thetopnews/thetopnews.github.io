### Library Size
The 3DS has a **massive game library** thanks to its long lifespan. From its launch in 2011 until production ends in 2023, the 3DS will have supported developers for over a decade. This massive **video game catalog** includes thousands of great titles from both the original Nintendo DS and 3DS eras, ensuring there are games for everyone. Whether you enjoy platformers, RPGs, puzzlers or other genres, the 3DS guarantees hours of fun and adventure.

### Homebrew Community 
For those interested in custom firmware and homebrew, the 3DS scene remains vibrant. Developers continue crafting new experiences, apps, and modifications for this thriving community. Now is a perfect time to explore the exciting possibilities of 3DS homebrew before support starts to wane. Whether you enjoy emulation, experimental apps, or unique multiplayer games, the 3DS homebrew scene offers endless **customization options**.
### Backwards Compatibility 
In addition to the vast 3DS library, this system remains fully backwards compatible with the immense DS game catalog. That means access to thousands more classic titles from yesteryear on a single device. For those seeking immense value and content in a handheld without expensive additional purchases, the 3DS offers unparalleled **backwards compatible gaming**.
### Online Services and Retro Titles
The Nintendo Switch delivers the modern experience with online multiplayer, but also thoughtfully provides classic retro gaming. Through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, users gain access to a constantly expanding selection of NES and SNES titles playable within the service. Switch owners can enjoy these retro gems alongside all the latest blockbusters for one affordable price. No other handheld can match the Switch's blending of modern and **vintage multiplayer games**. 
### Upcoming Support
Though the 3DS has reached the end of its primary development cycle, Nintendo commits to at least one more year of first-party support. Exciting new releases like the just-announced Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes and Kirby Canvas Curse port keep the handheld's future bright. Meanwhile, the Switch continues growing its library at a breakneck pace. For those still hungry for new 3DS experiences, 2023 provides more adventures ahead before the system sunsets. 
### Price and Value  
While the Switch remains Nintendo's newest machine, second-hand 3DS systems offer unbeatable **value for money**. Carefully shop refurbished models carrying a full one-year warranty from $80-150 USD. At that price, the 3DS achieves gaming expense parity with mobile phones but provides a true handheld experience alongside a virtual ocean of top-tier games. Even at launch, the 3DS undercut rivals by selling for the reasonable price of $249 despite packing two screens and 3D capabilities, a feat Nintendo's handhelds continuously achieve to this day.
### Present vs. Future Potential
Undeniably the Switch stands as Nintendo's future, but some question if that future remains distant. While 2017 launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild dazzles, the Switch saw few true heavy-hitters after. But massive franchises like Pok√©mon, Animal Crossing, Splatoon, and others now call the platform home ensuring its library grows stronger each year. The present may belong to the 3DS, yet the Switch's potential seems unlimited as more worlds open within its borders. Quality outweighs quantity for some, others for whom the future matters most will find Switch their best choice.
### Scam Warnings for Used Systems
Used game systems provide excellent value but unfortunately open doors for unscrupulous sellers as well. No legitimate used 3DS includes 70+ digital games, as those are tied to individual accounts not systems. Likewise, any 3DS described as 'new' but priced well below MSRP likely utilizes stolen or deceitful means and should be avoided. Legitimate used prices fall between $80-150 for basic refurbished models. Carefully research sellers and read reviews to avoid falling prey while still capitalizing on the 3DS's incredible value as a pre-owned portable powerhouse.
In conclusion, both Switch and 3DS deliver outstanding handheld gaming experiences depending on individual priorities. The 3DS remains a budget-friendly juggernaut for its deep library and backwards compatibility. However, the future clearly belongs to Nintendo Switch as an hybrid console for cutting edge experiences on the go and at home. Consider each option's library size, support lifespan, retro options, and potential price differences to determine the best fit!
