### Hardware Authentication and Communication Protocols
Mice and their receivers are carefully designed to only work together through proprietary wireless communication protocols. Most manufacturers pair each mouse with a specific receiver through coded authentication and transmission protocols. This ensures security, reliability and compatibility between the wireless input devices and computing systems. 
When you purchase a mouse and receiver set, the receiver comes **pre-paired** to the mouse through a unique authentication key. They establish a matched radio frequency and transmission protocol for smooth data transfer. This hardware-level pairing prevents interference and ensures smooth navigation between mouse movements and on-screen cursor movements.

### Proprietary Wireless Standards Limit Reuse and Modification 
Without access to the exact **proprietary wireless protocols** and firmware used between each mouse-receiver pair, it is extremely challenging to re-purpose either component for use with another. Reverse engineering these protocols require specialized equipment, strong software programming skills and detailed system documentation - resources not readily available to most end users. 
If the mouse or receiver fails due to normal wear and tear, the paired components must be replaced together as a set. Modifying or combining components from different manufacturers' mouse-receiver pairs is usually not possible without access to the underlying wireless protocols and authentication keys used. This limits extended reuse of the hardware and discourages user repair or customization.
### Exceptions that Prove Compatibility is Possible
A few manufacturers have taken strides to allow some interchangeability between their wireless input devices. **Logitech mice** marked with an orange "Unifying Receiver" logo can be paired with Logitech's universal USB unifying receiver for multi-device compatibility. 
Bluetooth also provides an alternative open standard. As Bluetooth uses a non-proprietary protocol, **Bluetooth mice** can generally be paired with any Bluetooth-enabled receiver or adapter, bypassing hardware-specific authentication. This cross-compatibility shows wireless standards do not need to be locked to specific paired components.
### Reverse Engineering a Proprietary Wireless Standard  
In theory, with the right laboratory setup and electronics expertise, it may be possible for a skilled technician to reverse engineer a proprietary wireless protocol and achieve cross-compatibility. They would need to extract the firmware from the mouse and receiver, analyze the wireless transmission protocols, decode the authentication keys, and match the radio frequencies and transmission signals between non-paired devices. 
However, such a major undertaking requires **extremely specialized technical skills** that far exceed what most end users or small repair workshops possess. The extensive time and resource investment would likely outweigh any benefits over simply purchasing a replacement mouse-receiver set from the original manufacturer. Aftermarket support also risks potential legal issues from manufacturers protective of their proprietary protocols.
### When is it Best to Simply Replace the Hardware?
For most average consumers and end users, the practical advice remains to purchase a new compatible mouse-receiver pair when either component fails rather than attempt to modify or re-purpose the paired devices. Unless a manufacturer like Logitech specifically designs for interchangeability, proprietary wireless standards lock components to only operate together as matched pairs for valid security, reliability and user experience reasons.
### Standards and Interoperability - A Balancing Act  
While proprietary protocols allow tight control of user experience and trouble-free operation, the approach also limits extended reuse of hardware and encourges more frequent purchases. Overly restrictive "pairing" of components hinders repairability preferred by sustainability-focused consumers. 
Manufacturers must balance open standards supporting interchangeability with design controls ensuring stability. The Logitech Unifying approach shows one path to increase flexibility while maintaining quality. As technology evolves, newer connectivity standards may gradually replace proprietary wireless with increased openness benefiting both users and the environment.
### In Summary 
Unless a device employs an open and compatible wireless connectivity standard like Bluetooth, attempting to reuse failed mouse or receiver components across different manufacturers' paired sets is generally inadvisable for all but the most skilled technicians. For practical home and office use, replacing the broken paired components remains the most reliable solution in near all cases. However, some manufacturers are exploring increased interoperability models that could pave the way for even more sustainable and eco-friendly approaches to peripheral device design in the future.
