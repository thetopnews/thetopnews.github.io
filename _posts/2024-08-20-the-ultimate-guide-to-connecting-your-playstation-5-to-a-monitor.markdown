### Choosing the Right Monitor
There are several factors to consider when selecting a monitor that will maximize your PS5 performance. **The screen size and native resolution** of the monitor should fit your space and gameplay needs. Higher resolutions such as 4K offer more detailed graphics, while 1440p or 1080p are sufficient for most games. **The refresh rate** indicates how smoothly fast-paced games will run, with 120Hz or higher recommended. Additionally, look for advanced features like **High Dynamic Range (HDR)** for enhanced colors, **adaptive sync support** to eliminate screen tearing, and a fast **response time** for minimizing blur. The panel type, whether it uses IPS or VA technology, also impacts image quality. Consider your **budget and future-proofing options** to get the best value over time.
### Setup and Connectivity
To connect your PS5 to a monitor, you'll need the console, monitor, and an **HDMI cable rated for the resolution and refresh rate** you intend to use.

Turn on the monitor and select the corresponding **HDMI input source**. Finally, power on the PS5 to view the display on the connected monitor. 
### Configuring Display Settings
Once your PS5 is connected to the monitor, take a few minutes to optimize the display settings. Access the **video output settings** from the PS5 menu to choose the output resolution supported by your monitor, such as **4K 120Hz**. If the monitor has integrated **speakers**, you can also configure the audio output within these settings. Adjusting settings like these ensures you are taking full advantage of your monitor's capabilities for the best visuals and performance.
