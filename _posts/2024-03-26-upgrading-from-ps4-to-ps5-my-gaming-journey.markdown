## Is it Truly Possible to Upgrade from a PS4 to a PS5?
For many avid gamers, upgrading from an older generation console to the latest and greatest new system can seem like an exciting prospect. However, when it comes to transitioning from the wildly popular PlayStation 4 to the highly anticipated PlayStation 5, a direct upgrade path simply does not exist. The PS5 represents a completely new gaming platform that requires a separate purchase rather than an in-console software or hardware update. 
### No Plug-and-Play PS4 to PS5 Upgrade Option Available
While some older games and accessories may be forward compatible between the two systems, **Sony has explicitly stated that the PS5 is not designed to function as a simple "PS4 Pro 2.0" console upgrade**. Gamers hoping for a seamless plug-and-play software patch to boost their existing PS4 hardware into full-fledged PS5 functionality will be disappointed. Instead, a completely new console purchase is necessary to access the PS5's redesigned system architecture and powerful new features like its custom **Solid State Drive (SSD)** and backward compatibility features.

### Expect Initial PS5 Supply Shortages Due to High Demand  
Given the immense popularity of the PS4 with over 100 million consoles sold worldwide, demand for the PS5 is anticipated to be through the roof at launch. Unfortunately, ramping up large-scale manufacturing and distribution of the PS5 in time for holiday 2020 will be an immense challenge amidst ongoing global supply chain disruptions and economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This perfect storm of factors all but guarantees there will be **significant PS5 supply shortages** in the console's first year as Sony struggles to meet pre-order demand. Gamers who wish to get their hands on a PS5 as soon as possible are advised to pre-order units the moment they become available.
## Taking My Time Upgrading From the PS3 to PS4 and Beyond 
While the technology landscape is constantly evolving at a breakneck pace, I've found that waiting a few years after a console's initial launch often provides the best experience as both software libraries and prices mature over time. In 2013, I purchased a "late model" PS3 nearly seven years after its original 2006 debut primarily to play critically acclaimed exclusives I had missed during my college years like inFAMOUS, God of War III, and The Last of Us.  
### Backward Compatibility Kept PS3 Relevant Long After Launch
Thanks to the PS3's **backward compatibility** with PS1 and PS2 games, I was also able to enjoy classic PlayStation franchises from my youth in high-definition for the first time. Additionally, many multi-platform games released new "GOTY Edition" bundles with all downloadable content included at budget prices. I had no regrets owning both a PS3 and PS4 concurrently, as each console had its own strong software library to enjoy for years to come.
## Evaluating the Best PS3 Exclusives Worth Revisiting
When researching which PS3 games would provide the most lasting entertainment value years after release, several critically acclaimed Sony exclusives rose to the top of the list. Titles like **Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch** impressed with its gorgeous Studio Ghibli art style and rewarding tales of magic and adventure. The **God of War** series concluded its Greek mythology saga in spectacularly cinematic fashion. And Naughty Dog raised the bar for storytelling and gameplay in interactive drama with **The Last of Us** and the epic **Uncharted** trilogy. 
### Sequels on PS4 Proved the Franchises' Longevity 
Having missed these landmark PS3 games initially, getting caught up through bargain "GOTY Editions" left me perfectly primed to enjoy their highlyanticipated sequels on PS4 as well. **God of War (2018)**, **The Last of Us Part II**, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom showed that with talented developers, some franchises can thrive across multiple generations. Playing the PS3 entries first enriched my enjoyment and appreciation of their PS4 follow-ups greatly.
## Benefits of Embracing Last-Gen Consoles Years After Launch
While the hype and novelty of brand new hardware is understandable, I've found numerous advantages over the years to continuing to support consoles long after their initial fanfare dies down. For budget-conscious gamers, waiting allows the best games to proliferate at rock-bottom prices in the pre-owned market. By the time I purchased my PS3 in 2013, top titles could be had for under $10 each regularly. Additionally, hardware tends to be significantly cheaper and more robust models are available. 
### Reviews Help Narrow Down Top Titles 
Perhaps most valuable of all, thorough reviews and community discussions have had time to parse the gems from the rubbish. This guidance helps discerning gamers make informed choices on the absolute best last-gen experiences still worth playing before moving forward. Especially for story-focused single player titles, experiencing some of gaming's greatest epics years later at a fraction of the cost seems a prudent strategy to prolong the lifetime value of any hardware investment.
## Originally Planning to Upgrade from PS4 to PS5 Around 2022
Writing in mid-2020 as the PS5 launch loomed later that year, my plan at the time was to stick with my trusty PS4 Slim for at least another couple years until the PS5 software and accessory ecosystem matured further. With the ongoing pandemic hindering global production, I anticipated **ongoing PS5 shortages and higher prices extending well into 2022** as demand consistently outstripped supply. Additionally, nearly all of my most anticipated exclusives like Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us Part II had only just released or were still to come on PS4 in 2020-2021. 
### PS4 Backward Compatibility Made Transition Less Urgent
Sony's early promise of **near-total backward compatibility** for the PS4 games also meant I faced no pressure fear of hardware obsolescence anytime soon either. My patience would allow the inevitable "PS5 Slim" redesign and inevitable price drops to emerge before making the permanent transition. Come 2022, I hoped to assess whether my must-play PS4 exclusives received substantive PS5 remasters as well for a truly "next-gen" experience on Sony's latest platform.
## Still Relying on PS4 Daily Over Two Years Later   
By late 2022, contrary to my original expectations, I remained a very active PS4 user on a near-daily basis. Benefitting from lockdowns and increased free time at home amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I steadily chipped away at my back catalogue of single-player narrative adventures and JRPGs over the two intervening years. Titles like Persona 5 Royal, Ghost of Tsushima, and Marvel's Spider-Man kept me thoroughly occupied and engrossed in many gaming worlds for dozens if not hundreds of hours each.
### Waiting for Larger PS5 SSD and Hardware Revisions
While the PlayStation 5 continued gaining traction amongst dedicated early adopters, I took a "wait-and-see" approach regarding a potential hardware upgrade. Reports of the PS5's ultra-fast solid-state drive filling up quickly due to large next-gen install sizes concerned me. I also held out hope that mid-generation "PS5 Pro" revisions might deliver a more fully-baked experience with expanded **SSD storage** and potential performance upgrades down the line
## Plans to Upgrade to PS5 in 2025 Barring Hardware Failure  
Fast forward another two and a half years to late 2023, I remain perfectly happy continuing to use my trusty PS4 on a near-daily basis. It has now seen over seven solid years of regular use and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. While next-gen exclusives like God of War: Ragnarok pique my interest, my backlog still grows thanks to PS Plus subscriptions and deep sale discounts. Barring any unexpected hardware failures, I have no plans or pressure to upgrade to the PS5 until at least 2025 when my PS4 will have served proudly for a full decade of gaming adventures.
### Still Hoping for Improved PS5 Revisions or Backwards Compatibility 
Sony's recent announcements expanding **PS5 SSD storage options** in Europe and hinting at possible future PS4 backwards compatibility do little at this point to push me from my dependable PS4 just yet. Only major PS5 hardware revisions delivering transformative new features like dramatically larger standard storage sizes or optional cartridge-based SSD modules would seriously entice me to take the plunge earlier. Until then, my trusty PS4 living room companion will continue to serve wonderfully well for games, movies and more.
## Continuing to Enjoy PS4 Library with New Extended Game Sessions  
Day-to-day, weekly gaming predominantly remains on PS4 nearly everyday in late 2023 and into early 2024. Thanks to life changes like divorce two years prior, I now have a TV dedicated solely for gaming in my home, allowing for significantly longer, immersed play sessions of deep single-player worlds without interruptions. This new setup further cements the PS4 as my primary system for a while longer still.   
### PS3 and Vita Remain in Rotation for Nostalgia 
Occasionally on weekends I still break out older PlayStation consoles like the PS3 for nostalgic favorites or to revisit eras past. However, the immense PS4 back
