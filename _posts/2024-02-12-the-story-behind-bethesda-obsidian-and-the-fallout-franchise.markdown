### **How Obsidian was Contracted to Develop Fallout: New Vegas**
In 2009, Bethesda Softworks contracted Obsidian Entertainment to develop Fallout: New Vegas as the next installment of the popular Fallout franchise. Bethesda had purchased the rights to the Fallout intellectual property in 2004 after the original developer Interplay Entertainment experienced financial difficulties. Eager to continue expanding the beloved post-apocalyptic franchise, Bethesda brought on Obsidian to handle New Vegas given the studio's pedigree in developing role-playing games. Under the terms of the deal, Obsidian would be given 18 months and an $85 million budget to develop New Vegas from the same game engine and assets used for Fallout 3.

### **New Vegas Surpassed Expectations Scoring an Impressive 84 on Metacritic** 
Fallout: New Vegas was released in October 2010 to wide critical acclaim, with many praise its return to the more story and role-playing focused roots of the original Fallout games. The game received an average review score of 84 out of 100 on the review aggregate site Metacritic, which was higher than Fallout 3's score of 84. Critics lauded New Vegas for its branching dialogue, consequences of choices and actions, and the quality of its side quests that offered as much depth and substance as the main story arc. Gamers also responded positively to New Vegas, appreciating Obsidian's improvements to the gameplay systems while capturing the wacky yet desolate atmosphere that defined the Fallout franchise.
### **Obsidian Missed Out on a Lucrative Bonus Due to New Vegas' Review Score of 84 Instead of 85** 
While New Vegas was widely regarded as a success, it narrowly missed out on a substantial bonus payment from Bethesda. Under the terms of the contract between the two companies, Obsidian would receive an additional bonus if New Vegas met or exceeded a review score of 85 on Metacritic. However, due to a few lower review scores, the average Metacritic score for New Vegas ended up being the slightly less impressive but still very good number of 84. As a result, Obsidian missed the review target threshold by a single point and did not receive the lucrative bonus from Bethesda that they had been expecting and hoping for.
### **The Financial Fallout of Missing the Bonus Payment Hurt Obsidian**
For a smaller developer like Obsidian, missing out on the bonus from Bethesda over one Metacritic point had material financial consequences that hurt the studio. Bonuses can often comprise a significant portion of a developer's budget, funding ongoing operations and future projects. Not receiving the New Vegas bonus placed additional stress on Obsidian's finances during a time when game development budgets were rising. It also meant fewer resources for the studio to work on their next projects. While New Vegas was still considered a critical and commercial success, not getting the full payment impacted Obsidian's ability to self-publish future projects for several years.
### **Popular Demand Emerged for Another Collaboration Between the Studios** 
In the years following New Vegas' release, many Fallout fans online expressed hope that Obsidian and Bethesda would team up again on another installment. Players appreciated how Obsidian had enriched the role-playing possibilities within Bethesda's foundation. Forums and subreddits were filled with suggestions on a potential "New Vegas 2" or discussions on how well Obsidian understood and honored what made the original Fallout games special. This persistent fan interest signaled that another collaboration between the two developers could unite the scaled world-building of Bethesda with Obsidian's knack for reactivity and consequence. 
### **Microsoft's Acquisitions Created New Possibilities for Cooperation**
In September 2018, Microsoft acquired both Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax Media and Obsidian Entertainment's parent company inxile Entertainment as part of a larger push into console game development. The acquisitions brought the studios under the same corporate umbrella for the first time since New Vegas. This raised hopes among fans that logistical and financial barriers preventing another team-up could be removed. With Microsoft now owning both developers, overseeing an Obsidian-led Fallout sequel or spin-off produced in collaboration with Bethesda appeared far more feasible than in years past. However, uncertainty remained over whether Bethesda still wants to pass key franchises to external partners.
### **Debate Continues Over Which Studio's Fallout Entries are Superior** 
A discussion that never seems to be fully settled is whether Obsidian's New Vegas or Bethesda's Fallout 3 and 4 are superior entries in the long-running post-apocalyptic series. Fan arguments on both sides raise interesting points. Supporters of New Vegas emphasize its branching questlines, impact of player choices on story direction, and faithful continuation of established Fallout lore and role-playing gameplay. Meanwhile, fans of Bethesda's entries praise the games' massive explorable worlds, visually grande scale, and improvements to first-person shooting. As the years pass, New Vegas maintains a cult following while Bethesda's entries have broader appeal but more criticism from RPG purists. This debate remains an evergreen topic fueling discussion around the Fallout franchise.
### **Could Obsidian Develop Another Fallout Under Microsoft?**  
With Microsoft now owning both key developers behind Fallout's most beloved entries, the prospect of Obsidian taking another stab at the franchise with fewer limitations is tantalizing for fans. Bethesda has shifted priorities to focus on internal projects like Starfield while their Fallout 76 live game saw a bumpy launch. As one of Microsoft's newest internal studios, Obsidian is in a prime position to spearhead another single-player focused Fallout adventure. However, any such project would require Bethesda's blessing and cooperation given their rights ownership. Only time will tell if Obsidian and Bethesda will reunite for Round 2, but Fallout fans everywhere remain hopeful that Microsoft's family may make this long-anticipated rematch possible down the road.
