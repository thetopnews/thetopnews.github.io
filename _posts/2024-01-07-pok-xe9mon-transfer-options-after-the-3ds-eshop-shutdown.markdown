### DOWNLOAD POKEMON BANK BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN DEADLINE
The shutdown of the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS family of systems in March 2023 means that players will no longer be able to download apps like Pokémon Bank digitally. However, for those who downloaded Pokémon Bank and purchased a subscription before this closing date, it remains usable afterwards. With the deadline approaching fast, trainers should act now if they wish to utilize the Pokémon Bank service going forward.
By downloading Pokémon Bank from the eShop and purchasing a standard annual subscription for just $5 USD before March 2023, players can continue backing up and transferring their Pokémon collections between supported 3DS games. Even without the eShop, downloaded software like Pokémon Bank can still be run on a user's Nintendo 3DS family system. It's **critical** for players who enjoy transferring Pokémon between games to secure Pokémon Bank now before time runs out.

### USING POKÉMON HOME ON THE NINTENDO SWITCH AFTER ESHOP SHUTDOWN 
For those who own a Nintendo Switch, transferring Pokémon collections to the Pokémon Home cloud service provides a pathway to preserve monsters caught in 3DS games long-term. Pokémon Home allows the deposit and trading of any compatible Pokémon across multiple recent games. To utilize this option, trainers must first link their Nintendo accounts between the 3DS and Switch platforms. 
From there, Pokémon Home can be downloaded on the Switch and used to deposit Pokémon directly from supported 3DS software like Pokémon Ultra Sun after establishing the link. A Pokémon Home premium plan, costing $3 USD per month or $16 USD annually, grants access to key features like transferring between games and the GTS trading service. While not as seamless as Pokémon Bank, Pokémon Home ensures Pokémon can continue their journeys across consoles even after 3DS online services end.
### USING THIRD-PARTY DEVICES TO BACKUP AND TRANSFER 3DS POKEMON SAVE DATA
For the most dedicated Pokémon fans still playing on 3DS systems, third-party devices provide another path forward after Bank is no longer digitally available. One such option is the Powersaves 3DS device, capable of backing up save data from physical 3DS cartridges onto an SD card. This data can then be transferred to another 3DS console to continue a game and maintain a Pokémon collection. 
However, using unofficial means like Powersaves does carry some risk. Save data could potentially become corrupted or lost, not to mention potential legal issues from accessing proprietary game data. Players should exercise caution and only backup critical save files if choosing this route. The inability to directly transfer Pokémon between the 3DS and Switch means third-party data management may be the only remaining method once online services wind down.
### UPDATING POKÉMON BANK BEFORE LAST USE
For Pokémon Bank to continue functioning properly after its associated online services eventually end, any player still relying on Bank must ensure both it and their Nintendo 3DS system are fully up to date. Pokémon Bank will refuse to launch if outdated, prompting users to update through the Nintendo eShop even post-shutdown.
Keeping Bank current is crucial, as the last known update in 2020 expanded its functionality to support **sending Pokémon to the Pokémon Home cloud**. Without the needed compatibility patches, this critical feature would be inaccessible. Regularly checking for and installing any available updates before March 2023 is advised. Even after online support concludes, a kept-current Bank can potentially preserve a treasured Pokémon collection a while longer.
### POKÉMON HOME CLOUD SUPPORT EXTENDS USABILITY WINDOW
When Pokémon Bank received its update in early 2020, the addition of Pokémon Home compatibility opened new possibilities for transporting treasured Pokémon forward into Switch titles. Through linking a Nintendo Account between the 3DS and Switch ecosystems, Bank and Home can now seamlessly transfer pocket monsters between their services. 
This integration point granted Pokémon an online pathway forward beyond the 3DS alone. As long as Pokémon Home remains accessible on the Nintendo Switch via a paid subscription, any Pokémon within Bank when its window closes can still be moved to the Home cloud for future use. While Bank's days are numbered, Home continues to buy more time to preserve old friends for new adventures down the line.
### ONLINE SERVICES END DRAWS TRANSFER WINDOW TO A CLOSE
While Pokémon Bank can still function locally once downloaded, other online-reliant 3DS services and games will lose functionality starting in April 2024. At this point, Nintendo will retire the backend authentication and infrastructure for most 3DS network features. This second looming deadline marks the true end of the 3DS era and any remaining windows for online Pokémon transfers.
After April 2024, transferring Pokémon from 3DS to Home or between Bank and other titles will no longer be possible once thoseonline services conclude fully. For the widest window to preserve collections, trainers are encouraged to complete any needed Pokémon migrations before then. Even if Bank can run locally longer, without online functions the 3DS-Switch transfer process will be terminated altogether. Advance planning remains key to future-proof virtual monsters. 
### CONCLUSION
With finite opportunities remaining before all 3DS-related online functions cease, Pokémon fans must carefully consider their options to preserve beloved friends collected across a decade of titles. Downloading Bank by March 2023 ensures local use, while Pokémon Home provides a cloud solution. Third-party data management and keeping everything current also help. Above all, trainers are advised to thoughtfully manage any needed Pokémon transfers between 3DS and Switch before network support ends completely in April 2024. Prompt action can safeguard precious Pokémon for adventures still to come.
