## The Issue with Printing Only Your First Name
Many individuals have faced issues with their Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards only displaying their first name despite providing their full name during application. This can cause mismatches when authenticating identity against other valid documents like Aadhaar that contain an individual's full name. 
### What Causes the Mismatch?
The key reason for this is that the Income Tax department database may only have an individual's first name stored against their PAN number. This is because the online PAN application form allows only the first 255 characters of an applicant's name to be captured. For applicants with long names, this often results in just the first name getting stored in the back-end records.

## Accessing the TIN Website for Name Update  
To resolve this issue, the first step is to visit the Tax Information Network (TIN) website of the Income Tax department. This can be accessed by navigating to `https://onlineservices.tin.egov-nsdl.com/etaxnew/tdsnontds.jsp`. On this page, click the **"Proceed"** button under the **"CHALLAN NO./ITNS 280"** section.
## Filling Out the Required Application Details
On the next page, select **"Income Tax (Other than Companies)"** as the applicable tax. Then select **"Self Assessment Tax"** as the tax payment category. Choose the relevant bank and assessment year from the dropdown lists provided. Enter your PAN card number and current address details.
### Viewing Your Name in PAN Records
In the field labeled **"Full name"**, you will be able to view your last name or surname as stored in the back-end PAN database records. This confirms the full name that will be printed on your PAN card if you proceed with the payment.
## Generating the Payment Challan  
Once all the required fields are filled, click **"Proceed"** to generate an online payment **challan**. This pre-filled challan will contain your PAN details pulled from the back-end records.
## Making the Online Payment
Select the **net banking** payment option and enter the required bank login credentials to make the payment through your chosen bank. Once successfully paid, the payment status will get updated online. You can also download an electronic payment receipt.
## Getting Your PAN Card Reprinted
Once payment is completed, the Income Tax department will reprint your PAN card with your full name as displayed on the payment receipt. This resolves the issue of only the first name getting printed despite providing your complete name during initial PAN application.
## Contacting Income Tax Department for Name Mismatch 
In rare cases where your PAN name still doesn't match the one on your Aadhaar after following the above process, you need to directly contact the Income Tax department through their website. Submit the required documents to initiate a review and update of your personal details in the PAN records.
## Conclusion
By generating an online challan and making a nominal payment via this process, individuals can now easily get their PAN cards reprinted with their full names as recorded with the Income Tax department. This eliminates name mismatches and issues in identity verification caused by the first name limitation in the older PAN application system.
