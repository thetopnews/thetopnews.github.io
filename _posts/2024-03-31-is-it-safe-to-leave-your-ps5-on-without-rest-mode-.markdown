### **The PS5 Can Handle Extended Idle Times Without Damage**
The PlayStation 5 is designed to operate for long periods even while idled. Leaving your console running continuously will not cause direct hardware failures or shorten the lifespan of your system. The internal components are meant to function without overheating even after hours of no controller input. Sony engineers implemented various automatic safeguards to prevent any issues from extended uptime. However, there are some other factors to consider with regularly leaving your PS5 running rather than using rest mode.

### **Increased Electricity Costs Over Time** 
Idling electricity usage on the PS5 is around 43 watts, which is comparable to keeping a standard light bulb switched on. This may not seem like much power draw for a single appliance. But when left running 24/7, those watt hours really add up on your monthly electricity bill. The PS5 consumes over 1,000 watt hours per month in a continuously on state. For reference, the average annual power bill in the United States is around $1,000 - $2,000 depending on location and household size. Leaving consoles and other devices idling can increase those costs noticeably over extended periods.
### **Prolonged Interior Heat Buildup Can Impact Performance** 
While the cooling system is more than capable of handling sustained operating temperatures, excessive long-term heat buildup inside the PS5 case is still best avoided. Heat causes gradual wear on internal components like the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) over many years of service. Giving the console occasional breaks to fully cool down helps maximize its thermal longevity. Providing ample free-flowing ventilation all around the PS5 also prevents interior temperatures from getting too high during marathons of idle time.
### **Regular Resets Help Maintain Optimal Functionality**
Even if left running 24/7, periodically powering off and restarting the PS5 refreshes important system buffers and caches. This optimization process clears out any degraded files or corrupted data that may slowly accumulate from long-term constant uptime. Simply shutting down your console fully once a month is sufficient for maintenance purposes. A quick reset takes less than two minutes and only improves performance over time.
### **Auto-Shutdown Safely Handles Prolonged Absences**  
Recognizing that users may occasionally leave their PS5 unattended for hours, Sony designed an automatic shutdown feature. If the console sits completely idle for 2+ hours with no controller input, it will power off automatically to prevent any risk of overheating. This protects the system in situations where the owner forgets to put it into rest mode before leaving the house for an extended amount of time. The shutdown occurs only when truly abandoned to safeguard hardware stability.
### **Rest Mode Conserves Electricity and Stays Cool**
Putting the PS5 into rest mode lowers power consumption down to just over 15 watts - less than half the usage of continual operation. It also stops all internal fan spinning to let components fully cool down between sessions. This prevents unnecessary wear from components operating at higher thermal levels for long stretches uninterrupted. Rest mode kicks back in instantly for quick resumes, providing power savings benefits without sacrificing convenience or performance.
### **No Major Issues From Continuous Years-Long Uptime**
Provided the PS5 has appropriate ventilation to dissipate heat effectively, anecdotal reports suggest the console can potentially survive 5+ years or more of total non-stop power-on time. As with any electrical device, component lifespan shortens gradually with age. But regular maintenance like occasional resets, keeping the area debris-free, and dust cleaning helps maximize usability over the long haul even with persistent uptime. Years of constant runtime appears harmless if common-sense care practices are followed.
### **Common-Sense Approach Based On Your Situation**  
In conclusion, while keeping your PS5 turned on all the time won't instantly destroy it, the best approach is to use rest mode when stepping away for more than an hour. This balances convenience with optimal performance and lower energy costs over the lifetime of the console. For short absences, leaving it running poses no harm. Consider your own gameplay patterns and environmental factors to determine what power state works best for maintaining your system trouble-free. Above all, exercise caution to prevent overheating issues through regular preventative maintenance.
