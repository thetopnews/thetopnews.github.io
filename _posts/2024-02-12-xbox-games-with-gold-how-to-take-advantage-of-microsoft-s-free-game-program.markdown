## Accessing a Growing Library of Free Games with an Xbox Live Subscription
### Getting Started with Games with Gold 
With an **Xbox Live Gold subscription**, Xbox owners can access a steadily growing library of **free Xbox One and Xbox 360 games** without any additional charges. Each month, Microsoft features **two backward compatible Xbox One games** and **two original Xbox 360 games** that Gold subscribers can download and add permanently to their collection. While these games are only “free” while you maintain an active subscription, they provide tremendous value for the low cost of Xbox Live Gold.

### Keeping Your Free Games Forever with an Active Membership
As long as your **Xbox Live Gold membership is active and in good standing**, you can continue playing all the Games with Gold titles you’ve previously downloaded without any limits. Microsoft grants you a perpetual license to access these games, though you don’t technically own them. So as long as you maintain your subscription, that growing library of several dozen free games is always available to enjoy.
### What Happens if Your Subscription Lapses
The one catch is that if you allow your **Xbox Live Gold subscription to expire** for any reason, such as forgetting to renew it, you will instantly lose access to all Games with Gold titles you previously downloaded, except for original Xbox and Xbox 360 games. This holds true even if you purchase a new Gold subscription later on. The only way to keep playing those Xbox One games is by purchasing the rights to own them permanently.
### Ensuring Long-Term Access with Advance Planning 
To guarantee long-term access, it’s important to practice advance planning as a Gold subscriber. Be sure to download all available Games with Gold titles each month, even if you don’t immediately play them, so your library continues growing. You might also consider converting to an **Xbox Live Gold annual membership** to save money and ensure your subscription doesn’t lapse unintentionally due to forgetting to renew monthly. Taking these proactive steps helps maximize the value of Games with Gold.
## Understanding the Different Rules for Legacy Consoles 
### Xbox 360 Backward Compatible Games Can Be Played Without Gold
In a consumer-friendly move, Microsoft grants Xbox 360 games downloaded from Games with Gold an exception to the requirement of maintaining an active subscription. Once added to your account, these titles can still be played indefinitely even if your Gold membership later expires. This alleviates the pressure to renew each year just to keep playing older 360 games received for free.
### Original Xbox Games Likely Also Remain Accessible Without Gold 
While not officially confirmed, most experts agree that the same rule applies to original Xbox games made backward compatible. Since these even older titles run on the Xbox 360 hardware environment, it’s reasonable to expect they won’t impose the Gold membership dependency like newer Xbox One games do. Subscribers can feel secure knowing their classic Xbox games will remain playable long-term.
### Maximizing the Value of Legacy Console Games
The ability to retain access to **original and backward compatible Xbox 360 games regardless of subscription status** provides excellent value on its own. It encourages gamers to explore older titles they may have otherwise skipped. Subscribers would be wise to browse through the full history of Games with Gold offerings on those legacy systems to further grow their permanent offline library over the years.
## Wrapping Up Games with Gold's Subscription Requirements
In summary, Games with Gold is an unbeatable free-to-play program, but one that requires active management as a subscription service. By committing to an annual Gold membership, diligently collecting all available free games each month, and taking advantage of the exceptional benefits for legacy consoles, subscribers can harness the full power of this unique program. With a little planning, the library of free games can continue expanding for years to come through prudent use of Microsoft's Games with Gold. Long-term access depends on maintenance of that subscription, so sign up for 12 months at a time to ensure continuous enjoyment of this premium benefit of Xbox Live Gold.
