## Part 1: Your Digital Games are Always With Your PlayStationTM Network Account  
When you purchase digital games from the PlayStationTM Store, these games become tied to your PlayStationTM Network (PSNTM) account, not the specific PlayStationTM 4 (PS4TM) console you downloaded them on. **This means if you get a new PS4TM console**, you do not need to repurchase any of the digital games in your PSNTM account library—they will still be accessible on your new console. All you need to do is sign into your PSNTM account on the new PS4TM to access all your previously purchased digital titles. Your game library is not hardware-specific; it exists independently in the cloud and can be accessed from any PS4TM by logging into your PSNTM profile.
### Getting Started with Your New Console 
Be sure to sign into your PSNTM account during the initial setup of your new PS4TM. This allows your console to sync with your online profile and download your full digital game library. Navigating to the **Library section** of the home screen after signing in reveals all games previously purchased for download. Select any title to instantly reinstall it onto the new console. There is no need to repurchase what you already own digitally—simply sign into PSNTM to restore access on a new PS4TM.

## Part 2: Play Any PlayStationTM 4 Game on Any Console Model
Another benefit of the digital game library tied to your PSNTM account is that **you can play PS4TM games across any console model**. The games themselves are not locked to a specific PS4TM hardware revision—all PS4TM consoles run the same software and are compatible with the full library of PlayStationTM 4 titles. This means games downloaded on an original 2013 PS4TM can still be played if you later upgrade to a PS4TM Pro or PS4TM Slim model years later, providing a flexible way to enjoy your digital library even with console hardware advances. Sign into PSNTM on the new PS4TM model to restore access to your whole game collection seamlessly without restrictions based on the console generation.
### Ensuring Online Access 
For online multiplayer, trophy syncing, and other networked features however, it is important to keep your console's system software up-to-date to the latest version through automatic downloads. New PS4TM system updates are periodically released by Sony to maintain security, compatibility, and performance. An **outdated console may be unable to connect online** or run the newest games if critical patches are missed. For full access to PSN’s online services with a new PS4TM, make sure to install any updates prompted during setup or found in Settings.
## Part 3: Finding and Downloading Your Digital Game Library  
After powering on and signing into your PSNTM account on the new PS4TM, navigate to the **Library section** of the home screen by scrolling right. The Library houses all of your previously purchased digital content in one place, whether downloaded already or available to redownload. Select the “Purchased” tab within Library to view a complete list of all games eligible to install from PSNTM tied to your account.  
To begin downloading and playing a title, select it from this list. The game’s tile will show the download status and size. High-speed internet is recommended to minimize waiting. Downloads can also be remotely queued from the PlayStationTM app on mobile if not at the console. Once finished, simply select the game tile again to start playing immediately. Repeat this process to restore access to your whole library of previously purchased digital games on the new PS4TM hardware in just a few taps.
### Keeping Track of Download Progress
For multiple large game installations, it can be helpful to monitor download statuses in the Notifications section instead of repeatedly returning to the Library. Notifications clearly list the title and percent complete for each active download. The Download List in Settings also allows pausing or restarting individual downloads as needed for bandwidth management. With these tools, it is easy to simultaneously queue restoration of an entire digital library to the new console over time, without constant menu switching.
## Part 4: Maintaining Online Access with System Software Updates
While purchased digital games themselves are playable on any PS4TM, taking full advantage of online connectivity through PlayStationTM Network (PSNTM) requires keeping the console up to date with the latest system software version. Maintaining an **outdated system could impact online features** like multiplayer gaming, friends lists, cloud backups and more by preventing access to critical security patches and service improvements.
### Why Regular Updates are Important
New system updates are continually released by Sony for a variety of reasons including bug fixes, enhanced stability, expanded feature functionality, and strengthened security protections. An outdated PS4TM risks being unable to connect to PSN services or run the most current games if several updates are missed sequentially over time. For this reason, it is important not to defer the installation of available system software downloads for extended periods. 
Unlike game downloads which can be spread out, system updates should be installed promptly upon notification for consistent online access and compatibility moving forward. Taking the few minutes for automatic installations preserves network functionality across the expected multi-year lifespan of each PS4TM hardware unit.
## Part 5: Running the Latest System Software  
After setting up a PS4TM and signing into PSN, it may prompt for pending system updates before full network features unlock. Immediate installation is recommended at this stage. You can also check for updates manually at any time by navigating to Settings > System Software Update > Update System Software. Letting updates run unattended overnight helps keep your console running smoothly with the newest online capabilities.
If a software update has been available for some time without installing, PSN features may already be disrupted until it's applied. Thankfully, large downloads can now continue even while in Rest Mode, making it more convenient than ever to stay current without disrupting gameplay. Over WiFi, updates typically complete within 30 minutes or less assuming adequate bandwidth.
### What Happens Without Updates
The potential risks of neglecting system updates include being unable to sign into PSN, launch online-enabled games, access online game modes and features, sync saved data to the cloud, or download new purchases from the PlayStationTM Store. Outdated consoles also face compatibility issues with recently released titles dependent on software version. To fully utilize all a PS4TM has to offer, keeping the system software up-to-date through automatic downloads is highly recommended.
## Part 6: Examples of Online Features Requiring PSN 
PlayStationTM Network (PSNTM) unlocks many enhanced capabilities beyond just online multiplayer. Some key examples of commonly used PSN-tied features include:
**Online Multiplayer & Communities** - Connecting with friends for cooperative or competitive play across various game titles. Interacting through communities, clans and leaderboards as well. 
**Trophy Syncing** - Unlocking and comparing trophies earned with other PSN players around the world in real-time and on the trophies ladder. 
**Remote Game/App Purchases** - Buying new content from the PlayStationTM Store when away from the console using the mobile/web storefront.
**Cloud Game Saves** - Automatically backing up saved progress to the cloud for access across devices. Restoring cloud saves also requires an internet connection.
**Automatic Game/Update Downloads** - Seamlessly downloading new purchases, patches and DLC in rest mode without user interaction through the download queue. 
Without maintaining updated system software, all of these pivotal online features and more would be inaccessible until the latest update is installed to re-enable PSN sign-in.
## Part 7: Maintaining Access Over the Long-Term  
As newer games are released and the evolution of online services continues, relying solely on outdated consoles poses risks to smooth ongoing functionality and feature availability down the line. Maintaining updated system software ensures optimized performance with any PlayStationTM 4 titles, whether released last year or years into the future.
Rather than waiting until prompted with a critical patch, setting up automatic downloads keeps things running seamlessly in the background without effort. Periodic checks can also uncover unexpected updates made available between automatic rollout cycles. 
With a lifespan of 5+ years expected for each PS4TM generation, dedicating a bit of effort now to regular system updates pays dividends long-term by sustaining access to the richest online experiences PlayStationTM has to offer throughout ownership of the hardware.
## Part 8: Exceptions for Offline-Only Play
The only real exception to promptly updating system software is for PS4TM consoles used exclusively in offline/single-player mode without requiring PSN sign-in or online features at all. In such cases, the console can responsibly be kept running previous system software versions longer as updates are not crucial. 
But even then, to benefit from added capabilities like remote downloads, cloud saves, or accessing newly purchased games/DLC, updating eventually becomes necessary down the line once internet connectivity is reestablished. And multiplayer-focused players should diligently stay current for optimal experiences with others online. Maintaining updates is simply best practice for the fullest access and longevity.
## Part 9: Downloads Required for Syncing and Store Access 
Two final but important notes regarding system updates - first, console system software and individual game updates/downloads are separate processes handled differently. Keeping system software current is required specifically to utilize PSNTM sign-in
