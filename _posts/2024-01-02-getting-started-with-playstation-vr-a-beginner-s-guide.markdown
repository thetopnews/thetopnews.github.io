##  : Setting up PlayStation VR
### **Getting Comfortable with the Hardware**
The PlayStation VR headset has built-in microphones on either the left or right underside depending on the version. For the original version 1 headset, the mic is located on the underside left side, while version 2 moved it to the underside right side. Getting adjusted to wearing the VR headset takes some time, as games are initially projected in front of you but won't track head movements upon first putting it on. You'll need to reset your view using the PlayStation controller. Additionally, motion controls won't work laying down at first, though many gamers enjoy VR titles from the comfort of a couch or bed once setup properly. I started with several demo games to get acclimated to different VR experiences and find ones that were easy to pick up and play for a newbie.

##  : **Initial Virtual Reality Impressions**  
### Examining Visual Quality and Immersion  
Visuals seemed a little foggy at first, with a slight blur that made it hard to make out fine details. It wasn't entirely clear if this was due to the resolution of PlayStation VR's screens or simply my body heat fogging up the lenses. More surprisingly though was how much motion sickness I experienced within the first hour, with dizziness quickly turning to nausea the longer I played. As an avid role-playing gamer, I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy PlayStation VR's launch lineup given these initial issues.

### Finding Joy in Unexpected Game Styles    
However, games like Eve: Valkyrie and DriveClub VR were titles that really surprised me despite traditionally not being interested in their genres. The novel change in visual perspective from playing in virtual reality considerably changed my gaming experience and level of atmospheric immersion. What I originally thought would bore me suddenly had me hooked, proving just how innovative virtual reality gaming can be.

### Solving the Biggest VR Hurdles    
After some experimenting, I discovered the initial fogginess affecting visual clarity was primarily caused by my own breath fogging up the lenses, which cleared up easily after wiping them down for a few minutes. There was still a slight underlying blur, which I suspect was partly due to using an older base PlayStation 4 model with less graphically demanding VR experiences. Thankfully, the resolution issue wasn't bad enough to hinder my enjoyment too significantly at this point.

### Getting Your "VR Legs" and Increasing Play Time
Once I resolved the lens fogging problem obscuring my view, I noticed my motion sickness symptoms also started to gradually improve. After just a couple more gaming sessions spread out over a few days, I was able to significantly increase my playable time in VR before symptoms kicked in. Within about a week, only a very mild dizziness remained even after extended **virtual reality game sessions**. It seemed getting accustomed to VR's novel 3D perspective simply took some adjustment and repeated exposure.

### Taking Immersive Driving Simulation to the Next Level  
Enjoying VR racing more than any other genre so far, I decided to splurge and purchase DriveClub VR for PlayStation VR. I've gotten countless hours of enjoyment out of it, and the immersive driving simulation has been so impressively realistic that I'm now seriously considering buying my first racing wheel controller to truly feel like I'm behind the wheel. The sensation of speed and g-forces in this game are unparalleled.

### Sticking with PlayStation VR Through Initial Challenges
In conclusion, while not without its flaws as a first-generation technology, the PlayStation VR system has provided me an extremely satisfying introduction to virtual reality gaming overall.

For anyone still on the fence about getting PlayStation VR, I would advise remaining patient through early challenges and keeping an open mind to explore different types of VR content. You're sure to find experiences that surprise and delight you in this exciting new medium.
