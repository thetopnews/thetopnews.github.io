For most everyday use cases, ScreenRec remains the top free choice due to unlimited recordings, no watermarks and simple interface. Gamers may prefer the built-in Gamebar for convenience on high-spec PCs. Bandicam offers quality paid features at a low price if you don't mind the watermark. And Oshi is worth learning for professional productions but overkill otherwise. Consider your needs then choose the right balance of features versus complexity for your projects. 
###Recording hotkeys and optimizations
Knowing hotkeys makes screen capturing quicker and easier. This section details keyboard shortcuts or clickable buttons to start/stop recording on each previously mentioned tool. It also explains where to find saved files and basic tips to optimize quality like disabling animations, closing unnecessary apps and adjusting microphone levels if included.
###Additional online recording options
A few other free tools deserve mentioning for their online recording capabilities. QuickTime works great for Mac users to screen share on any device. Tools like ShareX and Jing specialize in uploading quick screenshots or small video clips directly to services like Imgur, Dropbox and YouTube. Meanwhile, services like Screencast-O-Matic and Screencastify provide simple browser-based screen and camera recording within specific time limits.
###Conclusion
With so many options, thereâ€™s a screen recorder suited to any need whether creating comprehensive tutorials, sharing quick demos or live streaming games. Consider your goals, tolerance for watermarks and learning curves then choose accordingly. The top free choices for most users remain ScreenRec, Gamebar or LoiLo depending on complexity needs. But experiment to find the software that best fits your workflow, budget and recording projects. Capturing screens has never been easier!
