### Disable Overscan on Your TV For a True 1080p Picture
Did you know that your TV may be blocking you from seeing the full resolution of your PS4 games and media? Many modern TVs still have **overscan enabled by default**, which cuts off the outer edges of the picture and scales the image down. This can lead to black bars appearing on the sides of your screen when playing PS4 games. 
Overscan was originally intended for **CRT TVs** to avoid visibility issues with **analog broadcasts**. Since most content these days is designed for **digital HDTVs**, overscan is no longer needed. By disabling it in your TV settings, you'll see the **full 1080p resolution** that your PS4 and games are capable of producing. 
It only takes a few moments to access your TV's picture settings menu. Look for options labeled "just scan", "1:1 pixel-to-pixel", or simply "overscan". Disable this setting to immediately remove any black bars and reveal the **complete picture area** from border to border. Your games and shows will look sharper and more detailed than ever before on your big screen TV.

### The History Of Overscan And Why It's No Longer Necessary
In the early days of **HDTV adoption**, television programming was still being produced with **CRT displays** in mind. Before the transition to widescreen formats, many **standard definition shows** were composed and framed assuming there would be **overscan present** on the viewer's television set. 
This was done to avoid important image elements getting cut off around the edges of the tube. **Broadcast stations** likewise **included a small overscan margin** in their transmissions as a precaution. Otherwise, the risk was a portion of the picture unintentionally disappearing below or beyond the viewable area for some viewers.
However, as **digital HDTVs** rapidly replaced **analog CRTs** in the late 2000s, broadcast standards and production workflows both shifted to native **widescreen 16:9 formats**. Content is no longer composed with overscan in mind. Even **classic TV shows** are now distributed on Blu-ray and streaming services in their **proper widescreen ratios** optimized for current displays.
With programming specifically designed for **today's HDTVs without borders**, there is little reason to leave overscan active on most modern sets. It merely hides part of the image that could enhance your enjoyment. Track down your TV's overscan control and disable it for the maximum visible picture!
### Adjust Your PS4's Screen Settings Along With Your TV
In addition to ensuring your HDTV displays the full image area from the PS4, it's also important to properly configure the display output settings on the console itself. This will guarantee a perfect pixel-by-pixel **match between what's sent and what's shown**.
Navigate to **Settings > Sound and Screen > Display Area Settings** on your PS4. You may notice some **black bars** around the edges even after disabling overscan on your TV. Using the D-pad, shrink the on-screen markers inward until they tightly hug the video content with no **excess border**. 
This process trims away any **buffer pixels** added by the PS4 to safely frame the action within title safe guidelines. Expanding the markers outward slightly may also be preferred by some for visual consistency across different displays. Play around until you find the setting that makes your games look most impactful without cropping off anything important.
Proper adjustment of both your TV and PS4 unlocks the **full resolution potential** of the ultra HD gaming experiences the console was designed for. The optimized visual fidelity results in an even more **immersive experience**.
### Your PS4 Only Supports Up To 1080p - But That's Plenty
It's important to note that while 4K/UHD resolution has become mainstream on modern TVs, the original **PS4 hardware is limited to a maximum output of 1080p**. Do not expect games to run natively at **2160p** or higher on this generation of PlayStation. 
However, playing a **1080p signal on a 4K display** does not significantly degrade the picture quality either. In fact, most new 4K TVs are designed to upscale lower resolutions intelligently for a remarkably sharp picture. The higher pixel density also helps **minimize blurriness from scaling**.
As long as your PS4 and television display area settings are properly matched to remove any **black borders**, you'll still take full advantage of the **buttery smooth 1080p performance**. Games maintain their intended visual fidelity. It may not be true ultra HD, but it sure does look incredible on today's big screen televisions!
