South of Guadalajara, the shores of Lake Chapala have long attracted American and international retirees. Starting in the 1950s, the scenic lakefront region developed a strong expat population thanks to its reasonable costs, welcoming culture, and pleasant weather. Today, the towns dotting Lake Chapala's shores host vibrant communities of retirees from around the world. 
With a lower elevation and more tropical climate than other parts of Mexico, the lake region feels similar to coastal Southern California. Hobbies like golfing, tennis, hiking, yoga, and water sports enjoy year-round seasons. The historic town of Ajijic in particular has gained renown as an art colony, with galleries and studios throughout the village. Nearby Chapala and Jocotepec also offer small-town charm.

For warm, dry weather 365 days a year, the coastal communities of Baja California offer ideal retirement spots. With average highs between 70-80Â°F even in the winter months, places like Rocky Point, San Felipe, and Ensenada feel more like Southern California than northern Mexico. Proximity to San Diego means U.S. hospitals, stores and family are just a short drive away. 
Coastal Baja allows active retirees to golf, hike, kayak, swim, sail or simply relax in sunshine for every month of the year. English is widely spoken, and American expats find the culture and lifestyle an easy adjustment. While full medical care may require trips north of the border, basics are covered in local pharmacies and clinics. Low property costs let retirees truly live large on modest budgets in stylish beach towns.

In Puerto Escondido, life centers around fresh seafood, lazy beach strolls, yoga and art classes. Low winter rents in charming apartments or homes start as low as $300 USD. Healthcare is readily available yet affordable, as the Oaxaca region has a strong medical tourism industry. Residents enjoy friendliness from locals as well as international friends made through shared interests like surfing, fishing or community volunteering. Those valuing relaxed times in nature with a global-village feel gravitate to Escondido's special ambiance. 
### Colonial Charm in San Miguel de Allende
Nestled in the mountains of Guanajuato State, the colonial town of San Miguel de Allende casts a spell on visitors with its cobbled lanes, historic plazas and artistic culture. Colorful tiled rooftops line steep hills, while Baroque architecture from the 17th century survives throughout the well-preserved historic center. 
San Miguel draws an international crowd who appreciate the year-round mild weather, vibrant community events and affordable living. New residents often take Spanish lessons or art classes at one of the prominent creative schools in town. With its pleasant central square, charming boutiques and art galleries, world-class health facilities and gourmet restaurants, this central Mexican pueblo feels alive with creative energy. Expats relish the cultural stimulation along with the spiritual calm emanating from the mountains surrounding "the most beautiful city in Mexico".
### Quintana Roo's Laidback Caribbean Village Vibe 
In the tropical state of Quintana Roo, Playa del Carmen has grown into a prime Caribbean destination thanks to powdery beaches, the popular reef off Cozumel and growing nightlife. Yet just an hour south, Tulum evokes a much more laidback atmosphere and village feel. The ruins perched on dramatic coastal cliffs remain one of Mexico's most iconic archaeological sites.
Tulum's small downtown has a authentic, local flavor versus larger destinations. English is widely enough understood to get by, though living here improves residents Spanish communication skills. Healthcare is more affordable compared to its neighbors to the north. Low-rise apartments, condos and villas offer ocean views at reasonable price points. Between the white-sand beaches, Mayan heritage and chilled-out expatriate community, Tulum beckons those seeking relaxed coastal village living under palm trees.
