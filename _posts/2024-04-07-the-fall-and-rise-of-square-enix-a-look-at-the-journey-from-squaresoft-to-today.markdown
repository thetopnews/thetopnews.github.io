### **The Glory Days of a JRPG Powerhouse**
Squaresoft was utterly dominant in the Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) genre during the 1990s. Led by visionary director Hironobu Sakaguchi, the developer released a string of genre-defining titles that captivated audiences worldwide. Chief among them was the massively popular **Final Fantasy franchise**, which burst onto the scene with the 1987 original and only grew in popularity from there. Final Fantasy VII in particular became a true worldwide phenomenon upon its PlayStation release in 1997, cementing Squaresoft as one of the most successful developers in the industry. 
Their ambitious projects extended beyond video games as well. In 2001, Squaresoft released the feature film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, a CGI fantasy epic directed by Sakaguchi. With a sky-high budget of $137 million, Spirits Within marked Squaresoft's desire to expand their beloved franchises into new entertainment frontiers. However, it would ultimately prove to be one of the costliest mistakes in the company's history.

### **The Collapse: The Failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within**
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a commercial disappointment almost unmatched in recent Hollywood history. Against its exorbitant budget, the film grossed just $85 million worldwide during its theatrical run. The financial losses wracked Squaresoft's bottom line, erasing years of accumulated profits in an instant. Company leadership would pay dearly for the oversight; Sakaguchi resigned his role as vice president, while president Hisashi Suzuki took a voluntary 50% pay cut to assume responsibility. 
The failure of Spirits Within marked a dramatic turning point for Squaresoft. Continuing to fund ambitious creative risks no longer seemed prudent given their new fragile financial state. Mergers and acquisitions emerged as attractive alternatives to shore up losses, especially amid changing market dynamics as new console generations loomed. Behind the scenes, talks had begun with **fellow Japanese developer and publisher Enix** about a potential business combination. However, after Spirits Within bombed, Enix understandably grew cold feet about the merger prospects.
### **Leadership Succession and the Enix Merger**  
With Sakaguchi departed and Suzuki weakened, Squaresoft found new leadership in Yoichi Wada, a banking executive appointed company president in April 2002. One of Wada's first acts was to reignite merger discussions with Enix, with the goal of forming a joint publishing entity stronger than either company alone. This time, Enix agreed on the merits of pooling resources. In October 2003, the landmark Square Enix merger was complete, forming a new megacorporation with JRPG franchises like **Final Fantasy** and **Dragon Quest** under one roof.
### **Exploiting Nostalgia and Expanding Westward**
Wada aimed to leverage Square Enix's iconic properties like never before. His strategy centered on aggressively milking Final Fantasy through constant sequels, spin-offs, and remasters designed to prey on consumer nostalgia. At the same time, Wada made a concerted push to expand the company's global footprint - with a particular emphasis on **cracking the lucrative Western markets** that had largely eluded Squaresoft. To that end, Square Enix began localizing more games and courting partnerships with major Hollywood studios.
However, in their zeal to attract new Western audiences, Square Enix's output began to lack the creative risks and sophisticated storytelling their classics were known for. In chasing mainstream popularity, many felt the publisher lost touch with what made their Japanese-developed games special in the first place. Cautious fan reception to early attempts at breaking into Hollywood suggested Square Enix still had much to learn about understanding global fans on their terms.
### **Troubles for Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts** 
Wada's strategy of franchising out Final Fantasy hit serious speed bumps with the polarizing releases of Final Fantasy XIII in 2009 and its direct sequels. The once-revolutionary series felt drained of creativity and burdened by an over-reliance on predetermined story beats. Elsewhere, the long-awaited Kingdom Hearts III in 2019 suffered from a bloated development cycle and failed to innovate in meaningful ways. Square Enix's biggest franchises, the lifeblood of the company, were showing worrying signs of exhaustion.
Even perennial system-seller Dragon Quest faced new struggles to capture Western audiences. The universally praised Dragon Quest XI in 2017 underwhelmed sales-wise outside Japan despite the franchise's iconic status at home. Fans criticized the cel-shaded graphics for feeling dated and mission-based structure for lacking substance. These stumbles raised uneasy questions about Square Enix's ability to satisfy global fanbases as console generations marched on.
### **Financial Declines and a Change in Leadership**
By the late 2010s, Square Enix found itself in an undeniable slump. Wada's internationalization efforts produced measurable financial losses, with the publisher's market capitalization dipping far below pre-merger levels for Squaresoft. In increasingly dire straits, shareholders lost faith in Wada's leadership and vision. He resigned as CEO in April 2013, accepting responsibility for Square Enix's decline on his watch. 
Yosuke Matsuda succeeded Wada, introducing a new strategy focused on "staying small but choosing carefully." Gone were overambitious pushes into film and theme parks; instead, Matsuda aimed to refocus on the quality of Square Enix's video game output above all else. It was a tacit admission that chasing blockbuster stakes had damaged the soul of what made their games beloved in the first place. Successfully course-correcting to find that magic again would prove an immense challenge after so much lost time and goodwill.
### **Hints of a Renaissance?**
Yet not all was lost for Square Enix. More modest projects harkening back to their golden JRPG days found surprising success. The Bravely Default series on the Nintendo 3DS launched to popularity by capturing 2D SNES-style vibes. NieR: Automata transcended with its compelling post-apocalyptic storyline and action gameplay. 
Matsuda greenlit riskier projects that respected the developer's roots instead of rehashing nostalgia. The Secret of Mana remake was a labor of love for longtime fans. Octopath Traveler revitalized retro-RPG visuals to critical acclaim. Under Matsuda, Square Enix's output displayed a new willingness to experiment that Sakaguchi would have appreciated. 
Most exciting of all, the long-rumored Final Fantasy VII Remake remake finally launched in 2020. By splitting the iconic game into multi-part episodes, Square Enix bought time to rebuild its fan-favorite world with modern production values. Early impressions suggest this strategy may allow FFVIIR to satisfy both newcomers and lapsed fans. If successful, it could kickstart Square Enix's resurrection much like the original kicked off their rise over 30 years ago.
### **A Return to Form or Still Chasing Glory?**
Square Enix has come a long way since the Squaresoft powerhouse of the 1990s. Risks both creative and business-related did not always pay off. Yet under Matsuda, greenlights for passion projects signal the company may finally recapture some of its former innovative spirit. Final Fantasy VII Remake in particular carries high hopes of reinvigorating a legendary franchise with a balance of respect and modernization fans deserve. 
Still, Square Enix relies heavily on mining nostalgia from its vault of historic properties. Lasting success will require new franchises and risk-taking beyond safety nets. The next generation of consoles also brings new challenges of winning back audiences. Only by focusing on creating richly crafted worlds and memorable stories, not just replicating past successes, can Square Enix truly earn back its glory days prestige. The publisher seems aware of this tall task, and fans eagerly await seeing if their reformed vision can return JRPGs and Square Enix itself to an era of greatness.
