The student was interning at an electric utility and asked their supervisor about efficiently **scheduling maintenance tasks and work orders** for technicians in the field. Their supervisor said the company used **field service management software** to optimize routing and ensure work was completed as scheduled. Many popular apps existed for Indian companies, but none were truly designed for the unique needs of **field service work in utilities industries**. Most software options were expensive as they were created by US-based companies.
### **An Affordable Field Service Software Startup from India**

To promote their new beta software, Fieldy is actively marketing to Indian utilities and conducting widespread demonstrations of the product's features.
