Game sharing allows users to share their digital games across PlayStation platforms, conveniently expanding access for the whole family. Let's break down how this works and best practices to help you navigate game sharing securely.
## Setting Up Game Sharing  
To share your games, first designate one system as your "primary" console. On your primary system:
### **Designate Your Primary Console**  
Go to Settings > Users and Accounts > Activate as Your Primary PS4. This lets your account access downloaded content on that console without signing in.

### Sign into Your Account on Another Console  
Sign into your PSN account on a second PlayStation system. You'll now have access to all the games attached to your account on both systems. 
### Play Games Simultaneously
With your account signed into the primary and secondary consoles, you and another user can play the same shared games online or locally together in real-time.
## Rotating Primary Consoles
If you want to share games between consoles in your household on different days, you need to deactivate previous primary designations.
### Sign in Online to Manage Devices  
Access your account settings through the web or PlayStation app. Navigate to Device Management.
### Deactivate Previous Primary Consoles
Select the console you want to deactivate as primary. This takes games offline until reactivated as primary. 
### Designate the New Primary Console
Sign into the console you want to activate as primary going forward. Now it has full access to your shared digital library.
## Starting Fresh on a New Platform
While PlayStation platforms allow sharing, moving accounts between PlayStation, PC, or mobile requires starting over.
### No Cross-Progression Between Ecosystems
Progress, purchases, and game saves do not transfer between PlayStation and other platforms like Windows or mobile devices. 
### Rebuild Library and Progress
If upgrading or moving to a new PlayStation console, **your purchased games** must be redownloaded but **achievements and saved games will not transfer** - requiring restarting games from the beginning.  
### Begin Rebuilding on the New System   
Take time to rebuild trophies, levels, currency and other in-game milestones when moving between different PlayStation consoles or platforms.
## Securing Your Shared Account
With access expanded across devices, ensuring account security is essential to protect your game library and purchases.
### Enable Two-Factor Authentication
Through the PlayStation website or mobile app, turn on two-factor authentication for an extra layer of login verification beyond passwords.
### Use Unique, Strong Passwords
Don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Utilize long, random passwords combining letters, numbers and symbols to secure each account.
### Update Passwords Periodically
Rotate passwords every 90 days to stay ahead of database leaks exposing old credentials. Monitor login locations to detect unauthorized access attempts.
## Frequently Asked Questions
Game sharing often leads to common queries. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions:
### How Many Consoles Can Be Designated Primary?
Only one console can be activated as primary for a PSN account. Other consoles only gain access when signed into the same account.
### What If I Delete My Account on a Shared Console?  
Removing the account signs all other users out and blocks access to shared games until signing back in or redesignating primary status. 
### Can We Play Online Together With Game Sharing?
Yes, with one person signed into the primary console and the other on a secondary system signed into the same account, you can engage in online multiplayer together.
## Benefits and Limitations of Game Sharing
While game sharing provides value, be aware of certain constraints in how features function across shared devices.
### Conveniently Expand Digital Library Access
Designating primary status lets trusted family/household members access your full catalog of downloaded games.
### Online Features May Require active Account  
Leaderboards, trophies and online multiplayer usually demand the owning account actively sign in on the playing system for full functionality. 
### Monitor Deactivation Limits
Sony places restrictions on frequently removing/adding primary status to avoid overuse. Be aware of these policies to maintain access on all shared devices.
## Maintaining a Shared Account Responsibly  
With great benefit comes great responsibility in smoothly managing a shared PSN account over multiple systems.
### Communicate Changes with Share Partners
Inform others any time you need to adjust primary console designation or change passwords so games stay playable across devices.  
### Change Passwords Regularly
Rotate complex passwords every 3 months to frustrate hackers while activity monitors ensure only trusted devices access the account.
### Contact Support for Deactivation Issues  
If unable to remove primary activation yourself, reach out to PlayStation customer support professionals for helpful guidance resolving common problems.
In closing, game sharing delivers an excellent value for responsible users. By following security best practices and openly coordinating with share partners, your entire group can safely enjoy expanded access to your digital PlayStation library across multiple systems. With care and communication, sharing games can provide memories to last for many play sessions to come.
