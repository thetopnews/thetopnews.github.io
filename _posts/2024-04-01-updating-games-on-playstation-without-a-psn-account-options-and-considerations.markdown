### Why You May Need Game Updates Without a PSN Account  
As gamers, we enjoy playing the latest games and having access to all the updates and features developers provide post-launch. However, sometimes life events like moving houses or unforeseen circumstances with our internet service can leave us temporarily without access to PlayStation Network (PSN). **In this article, I will explore some of the options PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 owners have to keep their games up to date even without an active PSN account.**

### Physical Discs May Include Critical Day-One Patches
One method that still works is using physical game discs. Most big budget releases actually come with a day-one patch already on the disc to provide stability fixes and other improvements needed for the best gameplay experience right away. However, discs will only include updates available at launch and not any further patches released later on by the developer. If you insert an older disc weeks or months later, you would still need to connect online to download newer updates.
### Offline Update Packages for Limited Games 
A few thoughtful developers will provide offline update packages that can be manually installed later without an internet connection. These are usually available for download on their website and come as large zip files containing all updates up to a certain point. You would need to transfer the files to a USB drive and install them via the console's system software rather than downloading directly. However, **this option only covers a small portion of the most popular games and might not have the most recently released updates either**.
### Technical Workarounds like Proxy Servers Require Skill
For the more tech-savvy, it is possible to set up a proxy server on a local machine or smartphone to trick the PlayStation into thinking it has internet access. This can let you sign into PSN and download updates. However, complex technical configuration is involved and proxy servers are not foolproof. There is no guarantee they will always work or continue working long-term as Sony issues blocks. Debugging connection issues without a PSN support team to contact also makes troubleshooting difficult. 
### Internet Access Is Still Needed for Many Games
Even using the alternative methods above, **having a baseline internet connection remains necessary in many cases**. Some game updates actively require authenticating against Sony's servers to install and will not proceed without being able to connect online first. Offline packages also will not contain the absolute latest updates in most situations. So while workarounds exist, a total lack of internet access considerably limits the updates you can access for your games.
### Summary of Best Options for Game Updates without PSN
In summary, the most reliable options PlayStation owners have for keeping their games updated without PSN are:
- Using physical game discs, which may include critical day-one patches 
- Checking developers' websites for rare offline update packages if available 
- Setting up a technical proxy server solution for savvier users, though reliability can be an issue
However, no method fully replaces having both internet access as well as an active PSN account. The ideal approach is to get games updated before losing your network connection if possible. But these workarounds can provide a temporary fix in a pinch to continue playing your existing library while offline.
### Conclusion: Prioritize Internet + PSN for Updates Whenever Possible
While there are some limited workarounds available, **the best way to ensure all games receive timely updates and access all post-launch content is having both an internet connection and a valid PSN account.** proxy servers and offline packages are imperfect solutions that only cover a small portion of games. Physical discs only provide initial updates at best. If at all possible, the recommended approach is to maintain internet access alongside your PSN membership for fully enjoying all your PlayStation games. The alternatives should only be considered as a last resort when no other options are available. Reliable updates are now an integral part of the gaming experience PlayStation aims to provide.
