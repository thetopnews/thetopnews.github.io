With Black Friday just around the corner, gamers everywhere are eagerly anticipating the annual deluge of deals and discounts. While PlayStation 5 consoles have been tricky to find since launching in late 2020, dedicated PS5 hunters hold out hope that Black Friday 2023 will see boosted stock and enticing bundle packages. Let's break down what you can expect from this year's Black Friday PS5 deals.
## Major Retailers to Watch Closely 
Major retailers like **Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target** tend to unveil Black Friday PS5 deals well in advance and offer some of the deepest discounts. Be sure to sign up for newsletters and follow social media accounts from all the big box stores to stay on top of any announcements. Last year, Walmart offered the console bundled with an extra controller and a $50 gift card while **Target discounted the PS5 Digital Edition by $50.** With supply chain issues hopefully improving, we may see more robust console drops from major online and brick-and-mortar stores this season. Be prepared to act fast once deals go live, as inventory will undoubtedly fly off digital and physical shelves.
## Top Online Deal Aggregators for Browsing Savings
When the deals start rolling in, having a one-stop-shop to browse all the PlayStation 5 offers can save you precious time. Websites like **Slickdeals, RetailMeNot, and TechBargains** actively monitor deals across numerous retailers and coupon codes, compiling only the very best savings in organized lists. Use their search functions to scan for any existing or developing PS5 promotions. Fellow deal hunters also routinely post new finds in discussion threads, so these aggregator communities provide a valuable secondary resource for staying on top of Black Friday PS5 price drops. 
## Get inside Intel from Industry Forums
Beyond following major brands, tapping into dedicated gaming forums and communities ensures you don't miss any hidden gem deals or inside scoops. On sites like **Reddit**'s PS5 Deals subreddit and forums like Resetera, dedicated members often share retailer intel, restock notifications, discount codes not widely publicized, and first-hand accounts of previous sales. Engaging with these passionate communities is a savvy extra step to optimize your deal-hunting efforts as Black Friday approaches. Sign up to receive alerts for threads tagging PS5 deals to get a real-time edge on the competition.
## Compare Prices and Read Reviews Before Buying
With so many retailers slashing prices during big sales events, it's crucial to do your research **before** hastily adding to cart. Take the time to compare prices across major stores like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target using a price tracking tool to ensure you're getting the lowest available rate. Reading consumer reviews on specific console bundle options can also provide valuable purchasing guidance. This diligence will help prevent buyer's remorse and ensure any money saved truly is the best deal. Be prepared to wait patiently if a better offer could be just around the corner.
### Console Bundles vs Single Systems
Turning to pricing history, console bundles offering extras like additional controllers or select launch games usually see deeper discounts than standalone systems. Last Black Friday, Walmart and Target both offered the PS5 Digital Edition or Disc Version bundled with a DualSense controller and gift card for around $450-$500. Assessing the value of bundled extras is important when weighing single system offers that may be only $20-$50 cheaper sans extras. Quality of life items and select launch titles make console bundles strong contenders for optimal savings.

## Do Your Homework on Pricing Trends
A wise PS5 hunter gains strategic advantage by researching pricing trends and sales data from previous years. Since initially launching during the 2020 holiday season, the PlayStation 5 has seen discounts on major shopping holidays like Black Friday and Prime Day. Looking back, the average discount hovered around $50 off MSRP with some retailers going as high as $75 off or offering must-have bundles below regular standalone rates. With supply stabilizing gradually in 2023, this year's sale prices are predicted by industry analysts to align closer to or better the 2022 low of $450 after discounts and bundle savings are factored in. Staying educated on the ebb and flow of PlayStation 5 costs will sharpen your deal-sniffing instincts.
### 2022 Black Friday Recap
Last Black Friday saw major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Amazon slashing $50 off the standard $500 MSRP for disc drive PS5s. Some highlights included Walmart bundling an extra DualSense controller and $50 gift card with select consoles for around $450 total. Target offered the digital PS5 model at the lowest price of $350 with $50 savings. This year, we may witness broader and deeper price cuts across an expanded range of participating stores looking to clear out remaining 2022 stock before 2023 console refreshes. Analyzing deal patterns from previous Black Fridays prepares you to pounce when the optimal offer arises this season.
## Make the Most of Deal Alert Tools
If a console bundle or standalone system price drop aligns perfectly with your budget, being the quickest to purchase will make or break actually securing the in-demand hardware. That's where sign up tools right on retailer websites prove indispensable. Sites like Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart allow registering for stock availability and deal alerts via email and text. This heads-up on restocks and sales starts you with a significant leg up versus other prospective buyers. Following select technology and gaming journalists on social media is another fast way to catch wind of breaking PS5 deals before the masses. Be equipped and ready to checkout within minutes of an alert for maximum buying power this season.
### Additional Strategies:
With persistence and the right strategy, landing elusive PS5 deals is within reach this Black Friday. A few extra tips:
- Cross-reference deal aggregators often to double check for exclusive coupon codes. 
- Ask retail associates in-person about stock quantities and doorbuster dates/times if shopping in-stores.  
- Scope out local used game shops for open-box consoles refurbished via manufacturer warranty.
- Consider buying PS5 only bundles with games/accessories you'd enjoy anyway for optimal value.
Combining thorough research, preparation tools, and alternative purchase avenues greatly strengthens your deal-snagging chances as the sales commence. Staying proactively informed every step of the way is key to ultimate PlayStation 5 shopping victory.
In summary, this year's Black Friday is primed to deliver some of the hottest deals yet on the in-demand PlayStation 5 for diligent gamers. Major retailers, aggregator sites, industry forums, historical data, and deal alerts provide a full toolkit to maximize savings potential. With multi-channel intelligence gathering and strategic timing, PS5 hunters stand an excellent shot at upgrading to the latest Sony hardware without breaking the bank this season. Happy hunting and good luck landing that coveted console!
