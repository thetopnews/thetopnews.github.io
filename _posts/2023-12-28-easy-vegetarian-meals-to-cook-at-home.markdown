Cooking vegetarian meals doesn't have to be difficult or time-consuming. Here are some simple yet delicious vegetarian dinner ideas you can easily make at home.
### **Pinto Beans and Cornbread**
Pinto beans are a classic vegetarian protein packed with fiber. Cook dried pinto beans according to package instructions then season with salt, pepper, minced garlic and diced onion. Serve warm beans alongside a pan of freshly baked cornbread. This hearty meal comes together quickly for a filling dinner.

### **Mushroom Garlic Pasta**
One of the quickest and tastiest pasta dishes is mushroom garlic pasta. **Sauté assorted mushrooms** such as cremini, shiitake and oyster mushrooms in olive oil with minced garlic until tender. Toss cooked pasta such as penne or fettuccine with the garlicky mushrooms then top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. For extra nutrition, you can also add chopped kale or spinach to the pasta during the last few minutes of cooking. 
### **Simple Fried Rice**
Using day-old rice allows fried rice to come together in just 20 minutes. Sauté diced carrots, peas, cabbage or any other veggies you have on hand in vegetable or olive oil. Once softened, add diced tofu or tempeh along with soy sauce, rice vinegar, sriracha and sesame oil. Then stir in cooked rice and warm through before serving. Fried rice makes a filling meal that can be customized based on your leftovers.
### **Crispy Sriracha Tofu**
For an easy protein option, marinated baked or pan-fried tofu is delicious. Cut extra firm tofu into cubes and pan-fry in vegetable or olive oil until lightly browned and crispy. Then stir in minced garlic and **sugar, soy sauce and sriracha** to coat the tofu. The sriracha adds a nice kick of heat to this easy weeknight meal. Serve crispy sriracha tofu over rice with steamed or sautéed vegetables. 
### **Versatile Salads**  
Beyond basic green salads, homemade salads can be very satisfying as a vegetarian dinner. Try tossing mixed greens with roasted sweet potatoes, goat cheese crumbles, sautéed mushrooms and shaved Brussels sprouts. For protein, add grilled **halloumi cheese, tofu or hard-boiled eggs**. Homemade vinaigrette dressings complete these fiber-filled salad meals. With some protein and starch additions, salads become hearty enough for dinner.
### **Curried Vegetable Stew**
Warming curries are perfect for fall and winter meals. Sauté chopped onions and garlic in olive oil then stir in diced carrots, cauliflower, chickpeas and your choice of protein like tofu, tempeh or lentils. Add curry powder, garam masala, crushed tomatoes, coconut milk and vegetable broth. Simmer the vegetable curry until the flavors meld and vegetables are tender. Serve over rice with natural yogurt, mango chutney and fresh cilantro.
### **Quick Quiches**  
Quiche makes a satisfying vegetarian meal that you can prepare in under an hour. Mix eggs, cream or milk, cheese, spinach or other veggies then pour into a prepared pie crust. Bake quiche until puffed and golden brown. Enjoy individual quiches or cut one large quiche into wedges for easy dinners. Quiche freezes well for future meals too.
### **Pasta Salad for Leftovers**
Pasta salad is a great way to use up vegetables from other meals. Toss cooked pasta with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, chickpeas and your other favorite raw or lightly sautéed veggies. Dress the **vegetable pasta salad** with olive oil, red wine or apple cider vinegar, Italian seasoning and salt & pepper. Refrigerate pasta salad overnight to allow the flavors to blend before enjoying for easy lunches or dinners.
