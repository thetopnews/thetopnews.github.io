## Part 1 - The Appeal of Compact Size and Low Price
### **Affordable Next-Gen Gaming**
The Xbox Series S delivers next-generation gaming at an affordable price point compared to other new consoles. Priced at $299, the Series S is $200 cheaper than the flagship Series X. For casual and budget-minded gamers, the lower barrier to entry makes the Series S an attractive option to experience the newest Xbox games.

### **Space-Saving Design for Small Spaces** 
At just 275mm x 151mm x 63.5mm, the compact design of the Series S fits easily into tight living spaces without taking up a large footprint. The slim vertical orientation is ideal for placing on entertainment centers or desktops where space is limited. Its diminutive size allows for portable gameplay on the go or in dorm rooms thanks to the built-in AC power supply.
## Part 2 - Storage Constraints and Lack of Disc Drive Frustrate Power Users
### **Storage Quickly Fills with Large Next-Gen Games**
While 512GB of internal storage may seem generous, the Series S's storage is devoured rapidly by today's games which often exceed 50-100GB each. After just a few larger titles are installed, storage space runs low. This forces continual uninstalling and reinstalling to make room or use expensive expansion cards for additional space.
### **No Disc Drive Limits Game Library and Forces Repurchases**  
Gamers with extensive physical disc libraries from the Xbox One / 360 eras find the Series S's lack of an optical drive limiting. Favorite older games cannot be inserted and played without rebuying expensive digital versions. Those hoping the new console would revitalize a dormant disc collection are disappointed.
## Part 3 - Only a Marginal Upgrade from Xbox One X for Power Users 
### **Graphics Parity Between One X and Series S Frustrates Upgraders**
Many games like **Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War** and newer multiplatform titles display at near identical quality levels on both One X and Series S hardware. For power users still satisfied with One X performance, there is little incentive visually to upgrade consoles just yet.
### **Lower Specs Than Competition Underdelivers on Next-Gen Experience**  
In comparison to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Series S is significantly less powerful with only 4 TFLOPs of graphics performance versus 12TFLOPs on the high-end systems. Its GPU and CPU are less capable than competitors, potentially hindering true next-gen design possibilities.
## Part 4 - Preferred Alternatives for Dedicated Xbox Fans  
### **Used Xbox One X Delivers Disc-Drive for Less**
The Xbox One X is still readily available pre-owned and refurbished at prices close to or below the Series S. It offers a 4K-capable system with disc drive, avoiding storage/library limits while spending less than the flagship Series X.
### **Build Digital Library Slowly with Xbox One Discs**  
Gamers still satisfied with enhanced Xbox One games can build their digital library gradually by purchasing physical discs at lower used prices, then storing optimized versions in the cloud. Once the library is substantial, the investment in a Series X is better justified.
### **Series X is Ideal for Power Users and Disc Library Owners** 
For those demanding true next-generation specs and backwards compatibility via disc drive, the more powerful and capable Xbox Series X delivers everything enthusiasts want. Its higher cost is offset long-term by retaining physical media value and flexibility.
## Part 5 - The Issues with an All-Digital Future  
### **Lack of Resale or Loan Value Diminishes Game Ownership**  
Without optical discs, digital games cannot be resold, rented, or lent out like physical media. Gamers have no recourse to recover value from games they no longer want to play long-term. This could negatively impact the perceived value of the costly hobby. 
### **Reliance on Functioning Online Services Over Console Lifespan**
Independent of physical media, an all-digital library depends entirely on the continued availability and functionality of online stores, servers, and authentication services lasting the typical 7-10 year console generation. Outages or shut downs could render purchased content inaccessible long-term.
### **Higher Game Prices Without Competition from Used Markets** 
Physical used games create competition for new full-priced digital titles, incentivizing sales and price drops. But an all-digital future removes this secondary market, allowing publishers to maintain prices longer without devaluing new copies. This could drive up the long-tail costs of gaming significantly.
## Part 6 - Conclusion 
### **Series S Suits Casual Gamers but Not Power Users** 
While well-suited as an affordable entry point for occasional play, the Series S's restrictions on storage, library access and performance do not satisfy core gamers. Unless these shortcomings are addressed, it will remain a secondary system rather than a true next-gen flagship for dedicated fans. 
### **Physical and Digital Options are Preferable for Fans**
A hybrid model embracing both physical discs and robust digital stores, as found on the high-powered Series X, provides maximum flexibility for all types of gamers. For most, an all-digital future comes with too many compromises compared to retaining options offered by contemporary disc-drive consoles.
