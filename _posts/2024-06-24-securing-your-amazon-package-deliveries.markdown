### Protecting High-Value Amazon Orders
There are several options for Amazon customers who frequently receive high-value packages and want to ensure extra security during deliveries. One option is to **contact the merchant directly before checkout** to request a signature-required shipping option like UPS Express or FedEx Express. Most carriers have distinct **commercial delivery services** which mandate driver signature for proof of receipt. 
Another valuable resource is carrier online accounts like **UPS MyChoice**. Accounts provide visibility into deliveries and additional control over where and how packages arrive. UPS MyChoice members can choose to **redirect packages to Access Point locations** like The UPS Store for secure pickup instead of home delivery. This takes advantage of over 100,000 UPS Access Points around the country.

### Leveraging Delivery Notifications
Staying informed of package movements is key to protecting Amazon deliveries. Carrier accounts deliver **detailed delivery notifications through email and text alerts.** Customers are promptly notified when a driver scans a package as out for delivery or officially delivered. This timely tracking prevents packages from being left unattended for long periods. UPS MyChoice alerts can be customized to notify when packages arrive at an alternate Access Point location.
### Choosing Delivery Placement Options 
Providing specific guidance to drivers is another strategy to help deter theft. Instructions in the UPS MyChoice delivery profile like "please leave packages on side porch out of view" directs packages to less conspicuous areas. While instructions alone do **not activate signature requirements**, careful placement deters opportunistic thieves. 
The Postal Service **will also follow customer-provided instructions** for key concerns like apartment numbers in multi-unit buildings. Clear notes ensure the right address receives parcels during busy delivery routes. Well-marked spots away fromplain street view also preserve privacy for sensitive contents.
### Leveraging FedEx and USPS Solutions
While this article focuses mainly on **UPS carrier solutions like MyChoice**, FedEx and USPS offer comparable account-based tools. Signing up at FedEx Delivery Manager and USPS Informed Delivery provides tracking notifications and package redirects. 
FedEx holds select packages at FedEx Office locations for fourteen days of free storage. Both USPS and FedEx operate retail partner locations nationwide as alternative addresses. These carrier account options expand delivery control andsecurity beyond a home address alone.
### Summary of Strategies 
To summarize the best practices for protecting high-value Amazon deliveries:
- Request signature requirements directlyfrom merchants when possible  
- Leverage carrier commercial deliveryservices requiring signatures at businesses
- Create online UPS MyChoice, FedEx,and USPS accounts to redirect or monitor packages
- Provide clear delivery placementsuggestions in carrier profiles
