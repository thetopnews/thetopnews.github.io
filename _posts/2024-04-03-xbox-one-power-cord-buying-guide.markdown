## Choosing the Right Power Cord for Your Xbox One
With different Xbox One console generations come different power requirements. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the power cord needs of the original Xbox One and Xbox One S, as well as provide tips for selecting a safe cord to keep your system protected. Let's get started!
### Original Xbox One Power Needs 
The original Xbox One uses a unique "figure 8" external power brick to convert the alternating current (AC) power from your wall outlet to the direct current (DC) needed to safely operate the console. This **brick-and-cord setup** has one live pin and one neutral pin to deliver power through the included cord. While convenient, early versions of this power system were found to have potential **overheating and fire risk issues** if the cord became damaged or pinched.

### Xbox One S Integrated Power Supply 
Microsoft addressed fire concerns by moving to an internal power supply design for the Xbox One S. Requiring about 40% less space than its predecessor, the Xbox One S ditches the bulky external power brick in favor of drawing power directly through a standard **computer-style power cord**. The internal power supply handles all voltage conversion inside the slimmed down console body for improved safety and smaller footprint.
### Choosing a Replacement or Extension Cord 
If your original Xbox One power cord shows signs of wear, it's important to choose a replacement or extension cord designed with safety in mind. Microsoft supplied safety upgrade cords for the original console featuring an inline **residual current device (RCD)** to immediately shut off power in a short circuit event before a fire can start. As an extra precaution, look for cords with visible test buttons to regularly verify the important RCD component is working properly. 
### What to Look for in a Safety Cord
When shopping for a new cord, prioritize options with reinforced cabling, in-line surge protection, and an RCD safety shut-off feature. Retailers like home improvement stores will often carry specialty tested cords made specifically for consumer electronics that fulfill all critical safety requirements. Be wary of no-name extension cords that lack appropriate **certification markings** or fail to list important specifications. Your peace of mind and the well-being of your expensive Xbox investment are worth the small extra cost.
### Consider Your Console Generation 
Unless you need the enhanced video capabilities of 4K playback, upgrading from an original Xbox One solely for a revised power cord is usually not worth the expense if your current system is functioning well. While the Xbox One S uses an inherently safer power design, there's no real **upgrade to processing power or graphics**. For new console shoppers on a budget, the original model with a certified safety cord can still deliver a great gaming experience. Just be diligent about cord maintenance and positioning.
### Maintain Power Cord Safety
No matter which Xbox One generation you own, following some basic safety practices will help keep you and your console protected for many years of gaming enjoyment. Inspect power cords for damage regularly and replace if showing signs of wear. Avoid placing cords where they can be pinched or chewed by pets. Unplug your Xbox when not in use to prevent energy waste. With the right power cord and safe handling habits, you'll be gaming safely and responsibly.
## Choosing a Certified Safety Cord 
When the time comes to upgrade your original Xbox One's power cord, a brand like Belkin makes high-quality solutions. Their Belkin SurgePlus Power Strip with 6 Outlets and 4 Port USB Charging Station features built-in RCD protection, EMI filtering, and a 10-year warranty. An in-line design ensures safe power flow even if other devices on the strip develop issues. Independent certification logos provide peace of mind that all safety standards have been met and exceeds. For around $40 at retailers like Screwfix, it's an affordable way to keep gaming and charging multiple devices simultaneously with confidence. Investing a small amount now can help prevent potentially costly repairs or property damage down the line. Your original Xbox One deserves certified safety.
In summary, be sure to match your Xbox One console generation to the appropriate power cord type for optimized and safe operation. For original models, look for inline RCD surge protection and other certified fail-safe components when selecting a replacement or extension cord. With the affordable options available, maintaining power cord integrity should always be a top priority for avid gamers. Follow best handling practices as well to keep your gaming experiences stress-free for years to come.
