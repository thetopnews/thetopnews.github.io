### Choosing Comfort Over Criticism
It doesn't matter if you personally prefer partners to appear hairy or hairless; what really matters is respecting their bodily autonomy above all else. Putting pressure on someone to change their natural appearance against their will is disrespectful and can negatively impact their self esteem. Instead of making critical comments, focus on accepting your partner as they are. **mutual respect in relationships romantic intimacy autonomy.**

### Cultural Standards Shouldn't Dictate Choices
