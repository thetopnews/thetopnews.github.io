## Part 1: Downloading Your Digital Games Library 
Have you recently upgraded to a new PlayStation 5 console from your PS4? If so, you'll be pleased to know that **transferring your digital game library is a seamless process**. Simply sign into your PSN account on your PS5 and all of your previously purchased digital games will automatically appear in your games library, ready for redownload. Don't worry about losing access to titles you already own - your game licenses are tied to your PSN account, not the hardware. 
### Relive Your Favorite Adventures 
This means you can quickly jump back into all your favorite open-world adventures, competitive multiplayer matches, and story-driven campaigns without having to repurchase anything. Say goodbye to the PS4 and hello continued gameplay on the more powerful PS5. All your progress is right where you left off.

### Continue Your Trophies and Achievements 
In addition to maintaining access to your digital game library, carrying over your PSN account also syncs up any trophies or achievements you previously earned. You'll be able to pick up right where you left off on earning platinums and completing gameplay milestones.
## Part 2: Playing Your Physical Disc Games  
While **digital games transfer seamlessly between consoles**, what about those of you with large physical disc collections? Good news - your PS4 discs will work in your new PS5 hardware without issue. Simply insert any compatible PS4 disc into the PS5's disc drive and it will install and run the same version.
### Continue Favorite Franchises 
This backwards compatibility means you don't need to replay through all your favorites from the previous generation. Pop in that copy of God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, or The Last of Us Part II and immerse yourself in those worlds again at higher resolution with increased loading speeds.
### Maintain Large Disc Libraries
Physical media collectors can breathe easy knowing their expansive libraries remain usable on the new console generation. There's no need to keep both the PS4 and PS5 hooked up - just bring your discs over and the compatibility provides an easy upgrade path.
## Part 3: Transferring Your Saved Game Data 
Now that your **digital library and physical disc collection have seamlessly carried over to PS5**, the next step is transferring your saved game data so you can pick up right where you left off. There are a few different options available depending on your setup and preferences.
### Option 1: Direct USB Transfer 
For the highest fidelity transfer, the recommended method is to plug both your PS4 and PS5 directly into the same network using an Ethernet cable. This allows your saved datastored on the PS4 hard drive to directly upload over to your new console's storage. 
### Option 2: cloud storage 
If you have an active PS Plus subscription, all of your saved games are automatically uploaded to the cloud on a periodic basis. Then on your PS5, sign into your PSN account and redownload that game data from the cloud. This provides a seamless transition without needing local network connectivity between consoles.
### Option 3: External Hard Drive
As a last backup option, you can remove the internal hard drive from your PS4, place it in an external enclosure, and connect it directly to your PS5 via USB. From there you can copy all your saved data over to the PS5 storage to ensure nothing is left behind.
## Part 4: Expanding Your PS5 Storage with an M.2 SSD
While the PS5 comes with a generous 825GB of internal storage space, **external hard drive and solid state storage expansion is supported** to grow your available capacity over time. The console has an extra M.2 slot that allows for seamless installation of PCIe Gen4 SSDs for quicker loads and higher throughput.
### Compatible Expansion Drives 
Sony has tested and approved several high-performance PCIe 4.0 M.2 drives that meet the necessary read speed requirements. Models like the WD_BLACK SN850, Seagate FireCuda 530, and Samsung 980 PRO are all reliable expansion solutions.
### Easy Plug-and-Play Installation  
All that is needed to expand storage with an M.2 SSD is to power down the console, open the expansion bay cover, insert the drive, and replace the cover. No tools or complicated setup - the PS5 will format and optimize the new space automatically on next boot.
### Keep Growing Your Game Library
With storage capacity doubled through expansions like high-capacity 1TB M.2 drives, you'll be set for years of blockbuster gaming. Never worry about deleting games to make room for new downloads again thanks to the flexible upgrade path.
## Part 5: Transferring via External USB Drive 
While internal **M.2 SSD expansion offers top performance**, an external USB hard drive is a more affordable way **to augment your PS5's storage**. Almost any USB 3.0 or higher drive will work for **housingyour extensive game library**. 
### Compatible External Drives
Standard external HDDs or SSDs ranging from 500GB to multi-terabyte capacities can be safely utilized. Popular brands like Seagate, Western Digital, Samsung and SanDisk all produce drives maintaining the necessary Spec requirements. 
### Moving Games On and Off as Needed 
Installed PS5 games can be directly copied to the external USB storage or vice versa. From the storage settings menu just select which titles to move. This allows keeping a large rotation of games easily accessible without congesting internal space. 
### Not for Active Gameplay
The one limitation is these external drives can only store - not run - PS5 titles. So you'll still need space freed up internally to play. But it's a versatile archiving solution to have your entire library stowed away for just downloading as required.
## Part 6: Transferring Via Remote Play on Mobile Devices
In addition to traditional console-to-console transfers, Sony's **Remote Play functionality enables seamless session continuation across devices**. This includes the ability to stream your PS4 or PS5 games and resume saves on supported mobile devices via a WiFi connection.
### Continue Sessions on the Go 
Whether commuting or on a break, you can pull up your in-progress games anywhere via the PlayStation Remote Play app. Resume right where you left off with all settings, controls and progression intact without losing focus. 
### Wide Device Compatibility
The application is available on both **iOS and Android platforms**, allowing Remote Play on phones and tablets. As long as you have a stable home network, you can stream your games even on LTE/5G networks when away from home.
### Built for Continuity 
Remote Play was created with the player's convenience in mind. Thanks to its seamless transitions, you'll feel like you never stopped gaming - no matter if using the console, PC or any portable device. Everything flows continuously for an untethered experience.
