Genshin Impact has become one of the most popular free-to-play games worldwide since its initial release in 2020. While most players enjoy the colorful open-world and engaging combat mechanics on their mobile devices, many also choose to play on PlayStation consoles for a more immersive experience with better graphics. However, some players may want to unlink their Genshin Impact account from their PlayStation Network (PSN) account down the road for different reasons. This article provides a comprehensive multi-step guide on properly unlinking your Genshin Impact and PSN accounts through various methods.
### Contacting Customer Support Directly

### Checking the Game Settings
If emailing customer support does not resolve the issue, check within the Genshin Impact game itself by opening the settings menu. Look for any options related to account management, account linking, or specifically unlinking accounts. Some players have found a direct unlink button buried in the settings on their console versions. Thoroughly exploring the different menus may uncover a simple in-game method to unlink without needing to contact support. 
### Adjusting Platform Linkage Settings
You can also visit the Mihoyo Accounts website at account.mihoyo.com and sign in to access your profile management features.

### Live Chat Customer Support Assistance 
If all of the above methods were unsuccessful, contact Mihoyo customer support again for additional help. You may prefer connecting with a live agent through their website's online chat function. Provide all account details and thoroughly describe each step already attempted. A customer representative can further assist by taking a closer look at your specific account linkages. Live chats allow real-time problem-solving with an agent.
### Escalating Your Unlink Request
