### Introduction
With the surge of cross-platform play between consoles and PCs, many PC gamers wish to play their favorite PlayStation 4 (PS4) titles using a keyboard and mouse - the control scheme they are most familiar and skilled with. While the PS4 does not natively support keyboard and mouse for all games, with the right equipment and setup many titles can be played using these superior input methods. In this in-depth guide, I will cover everything you need to know to get up and running with keyboard and mouse on PS4 like a pro.

### Advantages of Using Keyboard and Mouse on PS4 
Keyboard and mouse offer unparalleled accuracy and precision for **first-person shooter** (FPS) and real-time strategy (RTS) games compared to gamepads. The immediate control over movement and camera provided by a mouse allows for lightning-fast aiming and target acquisition absent from gamepad controls. Additionally, many popular PC franchises like **Battlefield, Overwatch**, and Civilization are nearly impossible to play competitively against mouse users using only a controller. With a keyboard and mouse, PC gamers can take full advantage of these complex control schemes and input options tailored for these input devices. 
### Equipment Needed for Optimal Keyboard and Mouse Gaming on PS4
To start playing PS4 games using keyboard and mouse, you will need the following equipment:
- PlayStation 4 console
- USB wired gaming keyboard for navigation, text input, and hotkeys 
- USB optical gaming mouse for precision aiming and camera control
- **Powered USB hub** (if necessary) to add additional ports for connecting keyboard, mouse, and other devices without overloading the PS4's limited USB ports
Quality, gaming-grade peripherals are recommended to ensure responsive and glitch-free performance. Mice with optical sensors generally work best on consoles compared to laser sensors.
### Setting Up and Testing Your Keyboard and Mouse on PS4
With your equipment ready, follow these steps to set up keyboard and mouse support on PS4:
1. Connect your keyboard and mouse, either directly to the PS4 or through a USB hub.
2. Test that your keyboard is functioning properly by navigating PS4 menus and entering text.
3. For some keyboards lacking direct support, enable BIOS or control/setup mode to bypass potential driver conflicts.  
4. Launch a game that supports keyboard and mouse controls like Fortnite or Warframe to test mouse functionality.
5. Fine-tune sensitivity, acceleration settings and keybinds to your liking within the game's control options.
###Games with Native Keyboard and Mouse Compatibility on PS4
While not all PS4 games support keyboard and mouse input, many popular cross-platform titles allow playing with these traditional PC controls. Here are some of the biggest games with out-of-the-box support:
- First-person shooters including **Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone,** and Rainbow Six Siege  
- Battle royale games like Fortnite and Realm Royale
- Real-time strategy games such as Northgard and Celeste
- Competitive online games like Warframe and Dauntless
- Emerging esports titles like Rocket League
With more PS4 games adopting cross-play, the library of compatible keyboard and mouse titles continues growing each year.
### Potential Issues and Solutions When Using Keyboard and Mouse on PS4
While keyboard and mouse usually work seamlessly on PS4, a few issues may arise depending on your specific hardware. Here are some common problems and remedies:  
1) Incompatible mice - Mice with laser sensors may not track properly. Optical sensors perform best.
2) Acceleration/smoothing - High DPI mice may feel "floaty" due to console settings. Disable acceleration in-game.
3) Delayed key inputs - Using many peripherals through a single hub can cause lag. Use a powered hub or limit devices.  
4) Cross-play imbalance - Playing with KB+M against controller players may provide an advantage. Input matching could help even the playing field.
With some troubleshooting, these issues can often be resolved to ensure a flawless experience.
###Expanding Your Setup with a USB Hub
To attach multiple keyboards, mice, headsets and other peripherals without overloading your PS4's USB ports, a USB hub is essential. Look for a quality powered hub to deliver reliable, lag-free performance with any combination of connected devices. When choosing a hub, consider these important factors:
- Sufficient port count - At least 4-6 ports for common peripherals 
- Individual device charging - Hubs with charging support are convenient
- Durability and build quality - An aluminium case protects against damage
- Compatibility - Check hub works smoothly with PS4 and your devices
With the right USB hub, you can fully customize your keyboard and mouse gaming station without any connection or power issues.
### Dominating Console Lobbies Against Controller Users 
While some see keyboard and mouse on console as "unfair", with proper input-based matchmaking it can level the playing field. For competitive PC gamers, destroying console lobbies is extremely satisfying. Key advantages include:  
- Lightning-quick 180Â° turns and snap headshots in FPS games
- Pinpoint building and editing in Fortnite against joystick players
- Flawless control of high APM strategies in RTS and MOBA games  
With enough practice, it's possible to routinely outperform controller users despite any perceived aiming assist advantages. For those seeking to crush console competitions, keyboard and mouse is the secret weapon.
### Conclusion
Whether wanting to experience familiar PC games or gain a competitive edge over controllers, keyboard and mouse unlock the full potential of many PS4 games. With the right setup, tweaking, and practice, even hardcore M&K players feel right at home on console. For FPS aficionados in particular, superior precision and control are game-changing. By following this guide, any PC gamer can dominate on PS4 using their preferred input methods.
