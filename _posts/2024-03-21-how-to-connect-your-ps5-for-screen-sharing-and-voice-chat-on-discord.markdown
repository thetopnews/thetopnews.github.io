## Introduction: Stream and Communicate Your PS5 Gaming Sessions
This guide will show you how to set up your PlayStation 5 to stream your gameplay directly to Discord and communicate with friends using voice chat. By connecting your PS5 to Discord, you and your friends can **share gameplay footage, voice chat across platforms, and have an all-around better gaming experience together** regardless of whether everyone owns a PS5 or PC. 
### What is PS5 Remote Play?
PS5 Remote Play allows you to stream your PS5 gameplay to another device over your home network or internet connection. This includes being able to see what's on your PS5 screen and using a compatible controller to play. Remote Play is built directly into the PS5, so you don't need any additional hardware or software.

### The Benefits of Sharing Your PS5 Screen on Discord  
Discord is one of the most widely used voice and text chat platforms for gamers. By connecting your PS5 to Discord, you gain the ability to **screen share your gameplay, have concentrated voice conversations with your team, and invite friends to watch your sessions—all in one central hub**. This guide will walk you through setting up this integration so you can enjoy all the social features Discord offers directly from your PS5 games.
## Setting Up PS5 Remote Play  
The first step is enabling PS5 Remote Play on your console. Here are the basic steps:
1. Go to Settings > Remote Play Connection Settings.
2. Make sure "Enable Remote Play" is turned on. 
3. Under Connection Status, write down your PS5's IP Address. You'll need this later when connecting from your PC or mobile device.
4. Select devices you want to be able to use for Remote Play like Windows PC, Mac, iPhone/iPad.
With Remote Play enabled, your PS5 is now ready to stream its screen to other devices on the same network.
## Connecting PS5 Remote Play to Your PC
Now you'll download the Remote Play app and connect your PS5 to your Windows or Mac PC: 
1. Download the PlayStation Remote Play app from the Microsoft Store or Mac App Store.
2. Open the app and select "Add Device."
3. Enter the IP Address of your PS5 that you wrote down earlier.  
4. Sign in to the same PSN account used on your PS5.
5. Your PS5 should now appear—select it to start streaming your console's display to your PC screen.
At this point, you can use a DualSense or other compatible controller connected to your PC to play PS5 games remotely on your computer display.
## Sharing Your PS5 Screen on Discord  
To share your PS5 screen directly within Discord for voice chatting and screen sharing:
1. Right click the screen capture icon on your PC's taskbar and select "PS5" or PlayStation Remote Play.
2. In Discord, go to User Settings > Voice & Video and enable the camera and screen sharing toggles.  
3. Click the "Go Live" button in any server text channel to start streaming your PS5 display.
Your friends in voice and text channels on Discord can now watch your gameplay in real-time while chatting.
## Using a Wired Headset that Supports Both Console and PC
For the clearest communication quality across devices, it's best to use a **wired gaming headset with both 3.5mm aux and USB connections**. This allows plugging the headset directly into both your PS5 using the aux port and your PC using USB. 
Some popular options include the SteelSeries Arctis 1, Logitech G432, and HyperX Cloud Stinger Core. Most support input/output on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch and mobile via a single cable.
## Connecting Your Wired Headset to PS5
To connect your wired gaming headset to your PS5 for voice chat: 
1. Plug the headphone jack into the PS5 controller or the console's front panel 3.5mm port.
2. Go to Settings > Sound.
3. Set "Output Device" to your headset. 
4. Set "Input Device" to your headset.
5. Adjust mic monitoring and volume as needed.
Now both game audio and your voice will route through your wired headset when playing PS5 games either locally or via Remote Play on your PC.
## Downloading and Setting Up Discord on Your PC
In order to voice chat while screen sharing your PS5 games, you'll need the Discord desktop app installed on your PC:
1. Download the free Discord app from their website. 
2. Open Discord and create a new account if needed.
3. Join any existing server invites or create your own to game and chat with friends.  
4. Make sure "Input Device" and "Output Device" in User Settings are set to your wired headset.
At this point, both your PS5 audio and PC microphone should work within Discord calls and your friends can watch your streamed PS5 gameplay while chatting together.
## Adjusting Discord Audio Settings 
For the highest quality shared audio, adjust a couple settings in Discord:
1. In User Settings, go to Voice & Video.
2. Under Input, set the dropdown to "Exclusive Mode (Push to Talk)" and choose your headset mic.
3. Under Output, set the dropdown to "Default Communication Device."
4. Go to the Advanced audio properties and enable "Enable audio mixing (allow applications to be heard)" 
Now Discord, games, and chat audio will all blend together seamlessly for an integrated experience.
## Conclusion: Connect and Game Together on Discord from Your PS5
By following this guide, you've set up your PS5 to stream gameplay directly to Discord for shared screen viewing and voice conversations with friends. Whether you're playing online together or just looking to socialize, Discord provides a central place to get everyone in once place.
