Developing musical abilities takes dedication, practice and time. It's normal to feel frustrated when learning a new skill like making music. But with regular efforts and focus on progress instead of perfection, you can steadily improve and gain confidence in your skills. 
### Remember Where You Started
Comparing yourself to others will only lead to unrealistic expectations and discouragement. Everyone progresses at their own pace when it comes to artistic abilities. It's important to reflect on how far you've come already and recognize the small wins along the way. Focusing on personal growth encourages continued learning and makes the journey more enjoyable.

### Practice With Purpose 
Setting **dedicated practice time** is essential for development. Carve out sessions to work systematically on particular areas. Whether it's sharpening rhythmic skills, experimenting with new sounds or mastering a challenging piece, regularly practicing targeted elements ensures steady improvement over time. Track your progress to see gains and stay motivated. 
### Foster Creativity Through Experimentation
Don't be afraid to take creative risks and try new things. Music is an artistic outlet for self-expression - experimenting with different styles, genres and techniques expands your abilities and helps find your unique sound. **Have fun exploring** different melodic ideas, effects or production methods. Innovation often stems from playfulness, so make room for curiosity alongside discipline.  
### Seek Constructive Feedback
An outside perspective provides valuable insights one may miss alone. Ask other musicians, peers or teachers for honest input on works-in-progress. Focus feedback sessions on identifying strengths to build upon as well as areas for refinement. Incorporate suggested changes to continuously polish your skills. Appreciating both accomplishments and room for growth nurtures artistic development.
### Take Breaks to Recharge 
Frustration is normal during the learning curve but don't burn out from unrealistic timelines or self-imposed pressure. Regular breaks allow space to **decompress and recharge creatively**. Step away from the craft for a day or weekend, then return refreshed to practice with a new perspective. Balance dedication with self-care to sustain long-term progress and prevent burnout hindering your journey. 
### Collaborate for Inspiration and Support  
Working with others through **jam sessions, collaborative projects or local performing opportunities** provides social motivation and fosters a creative community. Observe how different musicians approach the art to broaden your palette of skills and styles. Exchange feedback and encouragement to stay invested in continual growth. Positive collaboration nurtures learning and passion for the craft.
### Maintain Perspective on Your Path
Comparing your journey to others' can distort reality and diminish hard-earned achievements. Each musician's strengths, weaknesses and evolution are personal and unique. Maintain an **optimistic outlook** focused on enjoying small wins, learning from challenges and gradually gaining mastery at your own right pace. Confidence comes from within by honoring small wins, persisting through setbacks and celebrating ongoing growth.
By consistently practicing purposefully yet playfully, seeking feedback from others and giving yourself permission to learn step-by-step, your musical abilities and confidence will steadily increase over time. Don't lose sight of why you started - make the passion and joy of the craft your compass point for an enriching artistic journey.
