## Changing Default File Associations  
One of the most common frustrations with PDFs is not being able to choose the app you prefer. Windows 10 makes it easy to change **default application settings** from the Settings menu. We'll navigate to the Default Apps page and select a new default reader for PDF files with just a few clicks. 
### Using File Context Menu Methods
Another quick way to change the default is through the file context menu. Right-clicking a PDF allows accessing the "Open with" option to select an alternate app. We'll see how to choose a new default and make that selection apply system-wide. 
## Editing PDF Content in Microsoft Word
While PDFs aim to preserve original formatting, sometimes text edits are necessary. Microsoft Word surprisingly allows opening and converting some PDFs into an editable format. We'll experiment opening a simple file and reviewing the editing capabilities within Word. Screenshots will demonstrate the process.
### Understanding Format Compatibility  
Not all PDFs can be opened and edited the same way. We'll learn why more complex formats with lots of images or scanned content may not convert smoothly. Understanding file types will help manage expectations for editable conversions.
## Working with Complex PDF File Types  
Scanned PDFs and those with extensive formatting pose unique challenges. This section will cover tips for working with **image-based PDFs** that can't be edited textually. Alternative apps and methods can help view and annotate these file types.
### Utilizing Optical Character Recognition
OCR (optical character recognition) software can analyze image-based PDFs and attempt to convert scanned text into an editable layer. We'll look at how OCR works and some free options available to extract text.
## Choosing the Best PDF Viewing Application  
With so many reader options, which is best suited for individual needs? We'll compare popular editors like Adobe Acrobat and SumatraPDF, outlining key features. Factors like cost, capabilities, and intended use cases will help determine the right solution. 
### Evaluating Needs for Home or Work Use
Choosing a PDF viewer involves prioritizing different criteria depending on how files will be used. This section discusses preferences for personal versus professional workflows. Things like collaboration, security, and compliance play larger roles in business settings.
## Additional Tips for Customizing PDF Behavior
Even after setting default apps and understanding file types, minor issues may remain. A brief recap of the main topics will be provided, along with bonus tricks for tweaking settings, troubleshooting navigation bugs, and other customizations. The goal is ensuring PDFs act as expected on any Windows 10 system.
In summary, this guide equips users with fundamental knowledge of editing PDFs, choosing applications, and managing default settings on Microsoft's dominant desktop platform. With these best practices, PDF files can be smoothly integrated into any workflow.
