### **How Voice Chat Was Enabled but Performance Became an Issue over Time** 
To use voice chat in Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch when it first launched, players had to navigate to the game's Settings menu, click on the speaker icon, and toggle the "Voice Chat" option to "On". From there, players could also adjust audio quality and turn subtitles on or off. Fortnite ran smoothly at 30 frames per second (fps) making voice chat usage a seamless experience. 
However, **over several major content updates,** Fortnite's performance on the Switch gradually deteriorated with worsening framerates. Where the game initially held steady at 30fps, it began dropping frames more frequently. Players watched helplessly as the dynamic resolution that aimed for 900p dropped lower to maintain performance. It was clear Epic Games lacked focus on optimizing for the Switch hardware as additional seasons and chapters progressed.

### **Screen Recording Secretly Removed and Hardware Limitations Begin to Show**
In a surprising move, Epic Games secretly removed the screen recording feature from the Switch version without any mention in patch notes. This was likely necessitated by the Switch's limited **memory constraints** of just 4GB of RAM. Screen recording would consume valuable memory needed to leave space for mandatory system processes while running a graphically intensive game like Fortnite. 
As a handheld device, the RAM limitations of the Nintendo Switch began showing limitations compared to more powerful consoles. Fortnite was a demanding game requiring optimization techniques to run without issues. But neglect from Epic Games meant changes went unaddressed, and problems piled on over time for Switch players.
### **Quality Declined from Launch as Optimization Efforts Ceased**  
When Fortnite first launched for the Switch in June 2018, it ran remarkably well utilizing dynamic resolution down to 900p. Visuals looked great playing on a television in docked mode. But lack of focus on the port led Epic Games to start replacing high-fidelity console visual assets with lower quality mobile versions. 
Draw distances and textures suffered huge reductions, making the world seem extremely flat and blurry compared to other versions. Performance barely improved despite the clear degradation of visual fidelity over multiple seasons. Switch players watched helplessly as the visual presentation continually declined without resolution.
### **Issues Persisted Despite Significant Downgrades**
No matter the visual downgrades through replacement of console-quality textures and assets with lower quality mobile alternatives, performance woes never improved for Switch players. Framerates became more unstable with each new season of additional content rather than remaining at a steady 30fps. 
Load times lengthened, making transitions between matches feel like an eternity. Server performance also degraded, leading to bugs, glitches and latency issues. It seemed Epic Games gave up on meaningful optimization entirely. Switch players faced a frustrating seesaw of broken updates that rarely resolved problems and usually made them worse.
### **Neglect Left the Port in an Unplayable State**
With no efforts by Epic Games to optimize the port or maintain a quality experience over time, neglect left the Fortnite experience on Switch in an essentially unplayable state for most. Where it launched as a surprisingly capable version, major issues went unaddressed until performance destroyed playability. 
Frustrations mounted over unstable framerates, dreadful resolution comparable to mobile quality, atrocious load times, and gamebreaking lag. Epic Games showed no care for the Switch community, ignoring pleas for help on forums. Many players felt abandoned, switching to other platforms or quitting the game entirely due to an experience ruined by disregard.
### **The Decline Directly Impacted Opinions and Enjoyment**
The gradual decline in quality directly impacted opinions on the Fortnite Switch port, transitioning it from an initially capable version many enjoyed to one that ultimately led to widespread frustration. Where Fortnite was previously a game people looked forward to playing portably or on the big screen, it transformed into a chore due to technical shortcomings. 
Most Switch players slowly stopped use of the port as problems mounted and fun faded. They traded in the disappointing version for other games that ran well and felt polished. The neglect spelled the end of Fortnite on Switch for many who had embraced it at launch. A tale of squandered potential, the port will stand as an example of how lack of support destroys communities and experiences.
