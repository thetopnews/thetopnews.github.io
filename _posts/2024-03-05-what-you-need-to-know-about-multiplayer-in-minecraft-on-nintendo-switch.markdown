### How to Play Minecraft Online on Nintendo Switch
Playing online with friends not on your local Wi-Fi network requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. This gives you access to **online multiplayer servers** where you can meet and play with other Switch players around the world. In addition to the Nintendo Switch Online membership, you will also need a free Microsoft Xbox Live account to connect to servers regardless of Xbox console ownership.

### Setting Up **Local Wireless Multiplayer**
While a Nintendo Switch Online subscription is unnecessary for local multiplayer on the same Wi-Fi network, the Switch does not support true **LAN play**. Even systems right next to each other still require an internet connection through the shared local network. To set up local wireless multiplayer, make sure all Switches are connected to the same router and have the multiplayer option enabled in their Minecraft world settings. 
### Enjoying **Split-Screen Co-op** 
No online memberships are required for **split-screen co-op** play on a single Nintendo Switch device. However, each player will need their own user profile beyond the primary one. With multiple profiles logging into the same world simultaneously, you and a friend can explore, build, and battle side by side on the same screen.
### Connecting Consoles for **Local Area Network Play**
By changing the game settings from online to local play, nearby Nintendo Switches can see and join each other's worlds without an internet subscription. Switches on the same **local area network** running the same game will appear in the local multiplayer menu once the world is set to local instead of online mode.
### Using Extra Controllers for **Two-Player Action**  
An additional wireless controller can be paired to the Switch for **two-player split-screen** without requiring online services. When starting a local co-op world, simply press the "+" button on the extra controller assigned to the second player profile to jump right into shared adventures.
### Troubleshooting **Local Connection Errors**
Occasionally an error related to Nintendo Switch Online may occur even during local wireless multiplayer. If this happens, try disabling the multiplayer option in the world settings temporarily. Editing this setting sometimes works around infrastructure issues that still need an internet connection to facilitate any kind of multiplayer on Switch.
### Wrapping Up **Minecraft Multiplayer Options**
In conclusion, Minecraft offers tremendous flexibility for gathering and collaborating with others on Nintendo Switch. While online coordinated play demands a subscription, nearby wireless and split-screen co-op remain free options for sharing worlds together in the same space. With the right setup, players can come together locally or globally within the block busting realm of Minecraft.
