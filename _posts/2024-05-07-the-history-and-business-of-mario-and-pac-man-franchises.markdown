## Part 1: The Origins and Early Success of Mario and Pac-Man
### Shigeru Miyamoto's Vision Brought Mario to Life
**Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto** created the character of Mario in the early 1980s for Nintendo's **arcade hit Donkey Kong**. Originally named "Jumpman," Miyamoto was inspired by the company's former landlord Mario Segale to rename the character. **Miyamoto's innovative platforming mechanics** in the 1985 NES launch title **Super Mario Bros.** took the world by storm, establishing Mario as a gaming icon. With over 350 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. remains the best-selling video game of all time.

### Namco's Pac-Man Blazed a Trail in Arcades
Meanwhile in 1980, arcade developer **Namco released Pac-Man**, designed by **Toru Iwatani** to be appealing to both male and female gamers. Players guided Pac-Man through mazes, eating dots and fleeing the ghostly pursuers Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. Pac-Man's **colorful cast of characters and simple yet engaging gameplay** made it an instant phenomenon, becoming the highest-grossing coin-operated game of all time. Its success brought arcades into the mainstream and popularized video games.
## Part 2: Distinct Franchise Formulas Keep Fans Engaged
### Mario Takes Platforming to New Heights 
The **Super Mario franchise expanded on Miyamoto's pioneering platforming** with new games introducing power-ups, worlds, and enemies. In **Super Mario World**, Yoshi helped Mario jump higher and eat enemies. Later 3D titles like **Super Mario 64** and **Super Mario Odyssey** took exploration to unprecedented heights. Each Mario game delivers **memorable characters and meticulously designed levels** that challenge and delight players of all ages.
### Pac-Man Variations on a Maze-Based Theme
While keeping the core maze gameplay, Pac-Man iterations featured new **mazes, graphics, power-ups, and gameplay modes**.  **Pac-Man Plus** offered a two-player competitive mode. **Pac-Man Championship Edition** increased speed and difficulty. The **Ms. Pac-Man** spin-off made the character more feminine. These adaptations maintain Pac-Man's simple **object-based control scheme but change up the core experience**. Both franchises find continual success by tweaking **proven formulas just enough to feel fresh.**
## Part 3: Legal Battles and Licensing Deals 
### Early Legal Dispute Between Nintendo and Namco
In the early 1980s, Namco attempted to sue Nintendo, arguing that **Mario bore too much resemblance to Pac-Man**. However, the **marked differences in characters, worlds, and objectives between the franchises meant this case would likely be dismissed**. Beyond both starring round characters, the games had little in common. The court ruled **gameplay innovations do not constitute copyright infringement**. This established an important precedent that **game mechanics alone cannot be patented.**
### Terms of Franchise Licensing Agreements  
To branch franchises into new mediums, **licensing deals must be negotiated**. Publishers seek experienced partners to ensure **high production values and faithful adaptations**. In exchange, licensees typically pay usage fees and royalties. Licensors maintain **strict quality control** to protect brands. For example, the **LEGO Mario line brought the plumber into construction toys** through an agreement balancing **Nintendo's vision with the LEGO Group's design expertise**. Careful cooperation between **rights holders and licensees unlocks new avenues of fan engagement.**
## Part 4: Maintaining Relevance in a Changing Industry
### Evolving Formulas for New Generations

Later entries like **Super Mario Odyssey** embraced **open-world sandbox gameplay**. Similarly, **Pac-Man CE** increased speed while **Pac-Man 256** brought **endless runner mechanics** to mobile. These **strategic formula tweaks kept franchises feeling fresh for decades.** Both companies know when to **push genres forward versus respecting nostalgia.**
### Expanding Beyond Games into Film, Television  
Seeking **alternative revenue streams**, both franchises ventured **boldly into new mediums**. The **2019 film Detective Pikachu** proved a box office smash by bringing Pokémon's world to life. Its success may inspire future **live-action or animated Mario and Pac-Man productions**. Cartoon **interpretations like Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures** introduced franchises to **younger audiences not old enough for games**. By **carefully broadening to respected partners**, the franchises find **synergistic ways to engage dedicated fanbases.**
## Part 5: Ensuring Quality Through Internal Development 
### Nintendo’s First-Party Studios Drive the Mario Vision
Rather than license Mario, **Nintendo handles all major games internally through acclaimed developers like Nintendo EAD and Nintendo Tokyo**. This **direct oversight preserves the care, polish, and vision central to the franchise**. Mario titles consistently **exceed sales expectations and receive widespread critical acclaim** for their **tightly tuned level design and charming gameplay**. As gaming’s most bankable mascot, Nintendo relies on in-house teams to **continually deliver quality experiences fans expect.**
### Namco Works Closely with External Partners
While Namco develops some Pac-Man projects internally, they also **collaborate with respected external studios like Hipster Whale and Tencent Games**. The endless runner **Pac-Man 256** came from an **indie developer partnership** that understood Namco’s vision. Meanwhile, the free-to-play **Pac-Man Pop! brought the franchise to mobile** through a **well-executed collaboration**. By **vetting partners carefully and guiding developments closely**, Namco maintains **consistent franchise quality** while unlocking new avenues for **Pac-Man’s continuing popularity.**
