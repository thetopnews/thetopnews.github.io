### **The Upcoming End of the Iconic FIFA Franchise Name**
For nearly three decades, Electronic Arts' (EA) flagship football video game franchise has gone by the name of FIFA, capitalizing on its licensing deal with soccer's global governing body FIFA. However, after months of negotiations, EA and FIFA were reportedly unable to come to an agreement on extending their partnership beyond this year. 
While the financial terms of the over $150 million a year agreement were a major factor, there were also cultural and strategic differences that contributed to the split. FIFA was looking to diversify and expand into new areas like esports and virtual products, which EA did not wish to support. After generating over $20 billion in total sales during their partnership, both companies felt it was time for a change as they head in different directions.
Fans of the series were shocked and disappointed by the news. The **FIFA franchise** had become synonymous with virtual soccer gaming for generations. Even with roster updates and enhanced graphics each year, keeping the iconic FIFA name brought a sense of authenticity and tradition. Letting go of such an established brand would be a major change for both gamers and the companies involved.

### **EA SPORTS Football Club - The New Name and Focus** 
In 2023, EA's football game will release under a new title - **EA SPORTS FC**. While disappointing for some, the core of what makes these games so popular will largely remain the same. Club teams, leagues, player likenesses and modes like Ultimate Team (FUT) will still be fully licensed and authentic. 
A bigger shift will be EA's reduced focus on **international tournaments and national teams**. With the FIFA license gone, they will no longer have the rights to things like the FIFA World Cup. However, they can still feature domestic cups and leagues from top divisions around the world. 
Many see this as an opportunity for EA to further enhance the club and domestic experiences, like more customized Career Modes. There is also potential to work directly with individual federations on unique national team licensing deals outside of FIFA's framework. Overall, the game itself is not expected to change drastically from a gameplay perspective.
### **Two Editions Available for Pre-Order Starting in September**
EA SPORTS FC 24 will officially launch on September 29th, 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Gamers can pre-order one of two special editions beginning in June to secure bonus in-game items. 
The standard version will be available for the typical $59.99 price point. This edition grants 3 days of early access to the game before its worldwide release at the end of September. Pre-ordering the standard edition also provides a limited player pick upon loading the game for the first time.
The **$99.99 Ultimate Edition** offers the biggest bonuses for the most dedicated football fans. In addition to the 3 day early access window, this version comes bundled with 4,600 FIFA points to immediately boost your FUT team. Other Ultimate Edition perks include a FUT Ones to Watch player item, a Kylian Mbappé loan player for 5 FUT matches, and a Team of the Week 1 player item.
### **Plentiful Bonuses for Those Who Pre-Order Right Away** 
EA is strongly incentivizing fans to pre-order FC 24 as early as possible through generous reward systems. Anyone who reserves either edition before August 1st will receive untradeable loans of star players like Vinícius Júnior and Mason Mount that can be used right away in modes like Seasons, Co-Op, and FUT. 
Career Mode players can also gain unique advantages through early pre-orders. Those who pre-order by July 15th will start their manager careers with an extra 500,000 coins to strengthen their squads. Gamers who pre-order by the end of June unlocks a rare player asset that can be used to sign high-potential youth prospects.
Pro Clubs and VOLTA players have their own batch of exclusive rewards for reserving FC 24 in the first month. Pre-orders before July 31st provide customization items, match coins and bonus XP to rank up faster in these online modes.
### **An Exciting but Uncertain Future for Both Franchises** 
With the FIFA license ending and both companies moving forward under new brands, the future of these iconic virtual football gaming franchises remains exciting yet uncertain. EA is confident that brand loyalty and licenses with other sports bodies can allow FC to succeed long-term, but questions linger until fans get hands-on with the final product. 
Likewise, speculation runs rampant on FIFA's bid to launch their own competitor series developed externally. Having the resources of the global governing body behind them could lead to unprecedented national team authenticity. However, building a brand new game franchise from scratch poses enormous challenges. Only time will tell how each publisher responds to the high-stakes changes coming in 2023 and beyond.
Both companies understand the importance of innovating while respecting the legacy and traditions which made these games so beloved worldwide. Gamers simply want the most authentic and engaging football experiences possible. With loyal fanbases and competitive pressures, EA and FIFA's newly separate futures ensure virtual soccer will never be the same - but possibly even better.
### **Potential Changes and Improvements to Career and Other Modes**  
Losing the FIFA license provides EA a unique opportunity to reconsider and revamp less emphasized areas of the game. Career Mode, in particular, could hugely benefit as it has often felt stale in recent years. Possibilities include a more **immersive youth academy system**, improved match sim logic, deeper league politics and challenges of building a club long-term.
Pro Clubs and VOLTA may see bigger changes with new features added or refined. Maybe Pro Clubs receives a story-driven narrative? VOLTA could expand beyond streets into 5v5 competitive leagues. Other potential innovations involve **coaching options in Career Mode**, additional women's national teams, or an overhaul of the career stats/records interface. 
Overall, no longer being confined by FIFA's demands may inspire EA's developers to take more creative risks across all game modes. However, making significant alterations also risks fragmenting the playerbase - a concern for any live service title. Striking the right balance between newness and familiarity will be key.
### **"It's Not About the Name, It's About the Game"**  
In the weeks since the announcement, online conversation has been mixed yet cautiously optimistic among hardened football fans. Many expressed annoyance at another yearly rebranded release but understood the business realities. Ultimately, most agree - **"It's not about the name, it's about the game."**
Both publishers face immense expectations. EA needs to prove FC 24 still captures that 'EA Sports feel' while boldly taking the franchise forward. FIFA's potential new partner also carries the monumental task of matching or exceeding the quality bar fans have come to demand. It remains uncertain if either can truly replace what the other leaves behind.
However, with billions still at stake and a global community of over 150 million annual players, the desire to deliver the ultimate virtual soccer experiences has arguably never been stronger. No matter the branding, football fans worldwide simply want the games that let them live out their dreams on the pitch. It will be immensely fascinating to see where EA and FIFA take their competitive passions from here.
