### Getting the Most Out of Your PS5's Built-in Storage
The PS5 comes with only 667GB of usable storage at launch, which modern triple-A titles can easily eat through. While this may seem sufficient at first, you'll find yourself needing to constantly delete and reinstall games to make room for new releases. **Sony wisely allowed** users to add additional M.2 NVMe solid state drives (SSDs) to expand available storage. Let's take a deeper look at how to optimize your PS5's storage capabilities.

### Requirements for Compatible PCIe Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSDs 
In order to use an M.2 SSD with the PS5, it must meet several key **technical specifications and performance standards**. First and foremost, the drive must be a PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD to achieve the necessary throughput. The PS5 supports common M.2 form factors including 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and the less common 22110. **Cooling is imperative** as SSDs can get hot under load—look for a drive with an integrated active cooling solution or plan to add a aftermarket heatsink. Lastly, the minimum sequential read speed should be at least **5,500MB/s to achieve optimal performance gains**.
### Disassembling the PS5 Console for M.2 SSD Installation  
To access the lone M.2 slot inside the PS5, some disassembly is required. Start by powering down the console and disconnecting any cables. Use a Phillips #00 screwdriver to remove the two bottom compartment screws. Slide off the white side plates and remove three additional screws to lift off the black middle cover. Finally, unscrew and remove the protecting cover over the M.2 slot. **Take standard electrostatic discharge precautions** when working inside electronic devices.
### Installing an M.2 SSD and any Necessary Heatsink 
If your chosen M.2 SSD lacks an integrated heatsink, this is the time to attach one. Most aftermarket heatsinks use thermal pads and screws to firmly mount to the SSD controller and flash memory chips. Insert the M.2 SSD at a gentle angle into the slot and secure it with the provided screw. Be sure not to overtighten. Replace all panels and screws in reverse order. Use the PS5 storage menu to format and start copying games to the new internal drive.
### Top Recommended PCIe Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSD Options for PS5
When it comes to best matching the PS5's performance needs, a few drives rise to the top. The Samsung 980 Pro is an excellent all-rounder offering read/write speeds up to 7,000/5,000 MB/s in a compact M.2 2280 footprint. It stays remarkably cool thanks to an integrated aluminum heatsink. The Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus is another top-tier choice delivering the same max speeds while saving a few dollars. For those after top-tier performance from a well-known brand, the WD_Black SN850 boasts the fastest overall speeds in the same class.
### Optimizing Your Game Library Storage Across Multiple Drives  
With your new expanded M.2 SSD storage installed, it's time to thoughtfully manage your growing PS5 game library. Larger titles that see frequent playing should stay on the internal SSD for snappiest load times. However, the new M.2 drive still provides a noticeable upgrade over an external USB hard drive. Consider installing entire game series you regularly comeback to on the internal drives. Then use the convenient storage management menus to freely move titles between the SSDs as needed.
### Formatting Drives, Expected Performance, and Troubleshooting 
Keep in mind that formatting any drive to work with the PS5 will completely erase all existing data. Make sure to back up anything important first. Also, while M.2 SSDs offer vast improvements over mechanical hard drives, not all PS5 optimized games will achieve their absolute fastest advertised load times depending the drive used. Contact Sony customer support if experiencing issues playing directly from your M.2 SSD after proper installation. They can walk through potential fixes or help determine if it's a hardware problem.
### Properly Removing an M.2 SSD
When the time comes to remove your M.2 SSD—whether to replace with a larger model or repurpose the drive for other use—simply reverse the installation steps. Power down the console, open it up, and loosen the single retaining screw. Gently slide out the M.2 SSD at an angle being careful of any cables inside. Replace the protective slot cover and reassemble the console. Remember to safely handle ESD precautions as with any internal component work.
### Frequently Asked Questions About PS5 M.2 SSD Expansion
Some questions consistently come up around adding M.2 storage to the PS5. Let's breakdown a few:
SATA SSDs are not supported—only PCIe Gen 4 NVMe drives will work. You cannot replace the internal SSD, only add via the expansion slot. Using an M.2 SSD does not void your console's warranty as long as no other damage is done during installation.
### Conclusion
Sony made a smart choice by including an M.2 expansion slot to grow the PS5's storage capacity over time. Selecting a high-performing PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD matched to the PS5's capabilities and properly installing it provides greatly boosted space for an expanding game library. With some thoughtful organization across drives, you'll stay ready to download the latest titles for years to come.
