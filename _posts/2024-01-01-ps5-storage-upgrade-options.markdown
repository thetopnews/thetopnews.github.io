## Part 1: Out of the Box Storage is Limited
### **The PS5's Built-In SSD is Fast but Small**
Sony equipped the PlayStation 5 with an incredibly fast solid state drive (SSD) that helped deliver lightning quick load times compared to the PS4. However, the custom 825GB SSD has only 667GB of usable space once the operating system is installed. Major titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War or Destiny 2 can easily consume 100GB each, quickly filling the internal drive. While the built-in SSD is ideal for playing PS5 games, its capacity is relatively small compared to traditional console hard drives.

### **External Storage is Restricted for PS5 Games** 
Out of the box, players have the option to expand storage by connecting external USB hard drives or SSDs to their PS5. However, Sony implemented restrictions that do not allow playing native PS5 titles directly from external drives. This is because PS5 games require fast SSD speeds to take advantage enhanced features. External drives can only store PS4 games or media like screenshots and video clips. For PS5 games, an alternate storage solution is needed beyond the default internal SSD.
## Part 2: Upgrade with **Compatible M.2 SSDs**
### Adding Fast **M.2 SSD Storage** is the Best Option  
To expand PS5 storage for native games, the console features an M.2 SSD expansion slot that supports drives meeting the required 5.5GB/s minimum bandwidth. This provides a straightforward upgrade path beyond the internal storage. Players simply install an compatible M.2 drive like the WD_Black SN850 and gain hundreds of additional gigabytes for their PS5 library. Using an incompatible slower drive could cause installation or playback issues for PS5 titles. Making sure to research and buy from a reputable brand is important for smooth, risk-free operation.
### Choosing the Right **Capacity M.2 SSD** Depends on Game Library
M.2 SSDs come in various capacities up to 2TB which is ideal for big game collectors. However, 1TB drives strike a nice balance of extra space without overspending. Players should evaluate expected storage needs based on typical game sizes and number of concurrent titles. Downloading full games instead of selectively installing modes can easily consume several hundred gigabytes. Choosing the right capacity M.2 ensures smooth storage management without constant shuffling of games.
## Part 3: Transfer Games Between Storage
### **Moving Games** Between Internal and External Storage
While external drives cannot run PS5 games directly, they serve an important role in freeing up internal SSD space. The PS5 allows easily transferring games to and from a USB hard drive or SSD in rest mode. This is useful for moving less frequently played PS5 titles off the internal drive to open space for new downloads. Later, games can quickly transfer back when players want to jump in again. External storage allows virtually unlimited retroactive expansion for the PS5 library over time.
### Keep Multiplayer Games on Internal for Fast **Load Times**
When shuffling games between drives, it's best to keep active multiplayer favorites installed internally. Fast SSD load times provide a competitive edge in games requiring quick loading into matches. This ensures leveling the playing field versus other players whose systems may read data slower from external drives. Single-player games and those played more casually can safely migrate as needed without impact impacting the experience. Proper drive assignment optimizes performance based on specific game and usage scenarios.
## Part 4: Future Updates May Expand Functionality
### Expect Support for **Playing PS5 Games from External SSDs**
At launch, Sony has not enabled playing PS5 games directly from external drives despite some meeting the required bandwidth specs. However, updates bringing this functionality seem increasingly likely. As M.2 and USB storage technologies continue advancing, drive speeds will continue improving to keep pace with next-gen demands. Once speeds support seamless gameplay, Sony will unlock the ability to run proprietary titles off externals. This dramatically expands potential storage without spending on frequent M.2 upgrades.
### **Backward Compatibility Could Improve Over Time**  
While PS5 is already backward compatible with the PS4 library, players hope compatibility may extend to more legacy platforms. Technological hurdles currently limit full backward compatibility with older consoles. But as virtualization and emulation techniques progress, older games from the PS3, PS2 or original PlayStation may one day run natively on modern hardware with enhancements. Future system software could streamline playing entire retro catalogs directly on PS5 along with modern titles.
## Part 5: Additional Accessories Continue Expanding Options
### Enterprising Manufacturers Delevop Creative Solutions
With Sony maintaining restrictions on external storage use, third parties have stepped up creating viable alternatives. Portable SSD enclosures allow installing compatible M.2 drives in a bus-powered USB housing for truly portable expanded capacity. Some even integrate cooling functionality for sustained high-speed transfers. Similarly, docks exist that securely hold multiple M.2 cards, treating them as a single higher-capacity volume over USB. These accessories creatively work around limitations to greatly increase effective storage amount. 
### Expect more official and unofficial Solutions over time  
As with all new platforms, additional storage solutions will emerge and improve over the console generation. Manufacturers continually evaluate what's possible within spec and demand. More elegant docks, rugged portable drives and other accessories expand convenience and choice. And although not officially supported yet, faster external SSDs may one day meet speed thresholds for broader functionality. The market ensures players have growing options that leverage cutting edge technology.
## Part 6: In Summary - Bright Outlook for Expanding PS5 Storage
In summary, while the PS5's internal SSD offered a fast starting point, true long-term storage options were limited at launch. Adding high-speed M.2 SSD expansion now provides straightforward upgrading that scales with one's growing collection. And future system updates hold promise to further relax restrictions by enabling extended formats. Additionally, third-party innovation will deliver even more solutions tailored for gamers' varied needs. Overall, the PS5 storage outlook remains bright as new frontiers continue opening through both official means and creative thinking outside the box. Players can rest assured their favorite platform will keep pace with advanced storage demands for years to come.
