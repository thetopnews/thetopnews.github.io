### Enjoying Entertainment in Space
Astronauts spend long hours conducting important scientific experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In between these tasks, however, they find time to relax and unwind, just like the rest of us. One popular way crew members stay entertained during their downtime is through video games. 
Back in 2008, President Barack Obama surprised the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery with a video call. During their conversation, a student asked the astronauts an intriguing question - **can you play video games in zero gravity?** To the student's surprise, one of the astronauts replied that yes, they definitely enjoyed gaming during past missions.

### The Work-Life Balance of Space Travel
With such a **demanding schedule of scientific research and maintenance tasks**, finding leisure time can be challenging for astronauts. Yet maintaining good mental health is just as vital as physical well-being in space. To strike a work-life balance, **NASA permits crew members to bring personal laptop computers** stocked with movies, music, digital photos from home, and of course, video games.
While gaming doesn't quite have the same feel without the familiar pull of Earth's gravity, **astronauts configure specially-designed controllers** that work equally well floating freely or tethered to the ISS. Popular titles include racing and shooter games that astronauts can get fully immersed in despite their unusual environment. The games provide a fun mental escape and chance to virtually experience sensations like driving or combat they don't encounter in their day-to-day careers.
### How 3D Technology Works in a Zero-Gravity Setting 
One might wonder how video games create a sense of **depth perception in three-dimensional (3D) space without the usual visual cues** we take for granted on Earth, such as retinal rivalry between our two eyes. It turns out that even without gravitropic orientation, the human brain is still able to perceive 3D from fine grids that block different images to each eyeball individually. 
Astronauts see two separate and slightly offset "stereo" images on their laptop screens, just like wearing 3D glasses at home. Their brain then processes this **binocular disparity to integrate the divergent viewpoints into a single, solid-looking shape**. As long as the visual system receives two perspectives, it can reconstruct the third dimension without issue regardless of one's physical position or the effects of microgravity.
### The Nintendo 3DS: A Popular Gaming Option in Orbit
One console that remains a staple aboard the ISS is Nintendo's acclaimed 3DS handheld gaming system. With its built-in autostereoscopic 3D display, **no additional glasses are required** - making it the perfect entertainment device for space. Its durable, enclosed clamshell design also stands up well to the harsh conditions of launch and prolonged zero-G.
Astronauts appreciate how the **3DS allows immersive virtual experiences** that remind them of Earth without needing heavy, expensive VR gear. Library titles cover a wide array of genres from action-adventure to puzzles to provide distraction and stress relief. While the regular 3DS model delivers quality gameplay at an affordable price, many astronauts opt for the larger screen and controls of the **3DS XL for enhanced comfort during extended gaming sessions** far from home.
### Choosing the Right model for Hours of Fun in Orbit
For casual gamers seeking an entry-level system, the standard compact 3DS is a great value. However, with the demanding schedule of an astronaut, more serious players appreciate the visual clarity and ergonomics of the **XL for comfortable gaming marathons**. Both offer the same library of amazing games, but the larger variant better facilitates losing oneself in a virtual world during precious leisure hours in the confines of the ISS.
Of course, budget must also factor into the decision for astronauts as it would for any consumer. But with prices falling all the time, more crew members opt for the immersive experience of the **XL lineup** if their schedules allow for longer gaming sessions spent worlds away from Earth. In the end, either 3DS model offers a welcome escape for intrepid scientists living outside our atmosphere.
