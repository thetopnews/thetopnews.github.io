### Slow Transition from Old to New
The Playstation 4 was one of the best-selling consoles of all time, with over 117 million units sold globally since its launch in 2013. **This massive installed base gave Sony an incentive to support PS4 games for years into the PS5 generation**. While the PlayStation 5 is praised for its much quieter operation compared to the noise of late-model PS4 systems, cross-generation games have continued well into 2023. 
Developers who began work on projects during the pandemic found it important to **maximize revenue by finishing games on both current and previous hardware**. Examples include Gotham Knights omitting the PS4 edition in October 2022, while Hogwarts Legacy delayed its PS4 and Xbox One versions by a month to February 2023 for additional polish.

### Maintaining Access for Millions of Players  
Sony is taking care to **gradually transition the existing PS4 fanbase to PS5 over several years**. With such a large PS4 installed base still in play, supporting cross-generation releases allows game makers to benefit from that massive audience. It also gives PlayStation owners time to upgrade to the newer system without missing out on big releases.
Many analysts predict 2023 will see the **continuation of cross-generation development for most major third-party games**. First-party PlayStation studios may start focusing exclusively on PS5 sooner, given Sony's stake in hardware sales. However, big multiplatform titles will likely keep PS4 editions into the second half of next year minimum.
### Backward Compatibility Extends Lifespan 
A key factor making the transition easier is the PS5's **backward compatibility functionality**, which allows players to enjoy their digital and physical PS4 games on the new system. They don't have to abandon their existing libraries when upgrading. This lessens the urgency for Sony to pull the plug on PS4 production and games before the installed base sufficiently migrates to PS5.
It's difficult to predict exactly when Sony will feel comfortable abandoning PS4 development altogether. Some think it may still be **3-4 years before PS5 revenue and userbase are large enough** for Sony to fully divert resources away from the previous generation. As more major publishers' upcoming projects shift to being next-gen only, the handover period will be complete.
### Maintaining Cross-Generation Revenues
For business reasons, keeping PS4 active as long as feasible helps **maximize revenues across both hardware generations**. As the gap between new and old consoles widens each year in technical terms, multiplatform development gets more complex. But compromising graphical or design ambitions to maintain last-gen accessibility is still worthwhile for commercial success.
Publishers with big multiplayer franchises or live service games have a strong interest in preserving **cross-play between platforms too**. It maintains the largest possible audience size and facilitates long-term player engagement in games meant to be played for years. For these types of titles especially, full generational transition may ultimately occur at a more gradual pace. 
### Focus Increasingly on PS5
By 2024, it seems almost certain the emphasis will **increasingly shift towards PS5-exclusive** experiences that leverage the new hardware's power. While accessibility will remain a priority for many multiplatform titles, first-party Sony studios have indicated 2023 may see their first true next-gen-only games since the DualSense controller's unique features demand it.
As more players make the move to PS5 and the platform matures with a growing exclusive software catalog, Sony's post-pandemic goal of **accelerating the user transition from PS4 will be well underway.** The install base that took years to build will be replaced, with the PS5 on track to surpass its predecessor in due time.
### Discussing the Transition's Progress
Two years on from the PS5's launch during extraordinary circumstances, the generational transition appears to **still be in its early stages as expected**. With tens of millions still playing on PS4 worldwide, a slow, methodical approach to maintaining cross-generation support makes business sense. 
Has the pace of change met expectations so far? How long do readers foresee continued cross-generation development lasting? As the installed bases shift over the coming years, discuss your thoughts on the next steps in Sony's multi-year strategy to fully transition to PS5 while respecting the gameplay needs of the existing fandom.
