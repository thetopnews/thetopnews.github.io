### A Common Teenage Scam Strategy
Gaming gift cards are very popular gifts for **teenage gamers in America**. However, some unscrupulous individuals have found ways to **exploit gaming gift card systems and scam retailers**. For example, a few years ago, there were reports of **two teenage friends calling random GameStop stores pretending to be from Microsoft or Sony**. According to eyewitness accounts, they would convince store employees to **open physical gift cards and read out the redemption codes over the phone under the guise of "verifying" or "activating" the cards for the company**. With thecodes revealed, one friend would immediately log into their gaming console and **redeem the funds before the store realized what happened**. Reports indicate they were often able to unlawfully obtain **$10 to $50 worth of gaming currency and memberships** this way. By targeting different retailers each time, the scam worked around **70% of attempts** before stores caught on to the scheme.

### Signs a Card May Not Have Been Properly Activated 
If you purchase a gift card only to find the redemption code is reported as **invalid by the gaming network or console**, there are a few things you should do. First, take the **physical card or receipt back to the store you purchased it from.** Have the store clerk **double check in their system that the card was successfully activated at the point of sale**. For digital codes purchased separately from physical cards, contact the seller to confirm **they properly activated the card online when it was purchased.** Gaming platforms are only able to recognize codes that have been activated ahead of time. If issues persist, you may need to consider **returning or exchanging the gift card for a properly functioning one**.
### Best Practices for Activating PlayStation Cards Yourself
Rather than relying on a third party, it's usually best to take responsibility for **properly redeeming PlayStation cards yourself.** This helps ensure the funds are secured on your account right away. Only purchase cards from **authorized PlayStation retailers you can trust** to sell legitimate products. When you receive the card, either physically or via email code, follow these steps: **Scratch off the protective coating on physical cards to reveal the long redemption code**. For digital codes, have the full alphanumeric string ready. **Sign in to your PlayStation Network account through the console, website or mobile app**. Navigate to the **"Redeem Codes"** section within the PlayStation Store.
### Entering and Redeeming the PlayStation Code 
Once in the redemption page, carefully **enter the lengthy alpha-numeric code without any mistakes**. Pay close attention to **capitalization, numbers and symbols** since codes are case-sensitive. After inputting the full code, **double and triple check that all characters were entered correctly** to avoid errors. Follow any on-screen prompts to **review and confirm** the redemption process. Within a few minutes, you should see the redeemed funds **reflected in your PlayStation wallet balance** ready to use on games, add-ons, movies or subscriptions. Consult customer support only if the validation and redemption steps failed after triple checking for typos or connectivity issues.  
### What to Do if An Issues Arises When Redeeming
No one wants to deal with problems when trying to use their hard-earned gift cards. If after carefully entering the full code as instructed above you are still receiving an "Invalid Code" response, don't panic. First, calmly **recheck that each letter and number was entered correctly without any mistakes.** Typos are one of the most common reasons for rejection. If everything matches, your next step depends on the card's source. For retailer-purchased physical cards, return to the store for an **exchange or refund** if their system shows it wasn't activated properly. For codes received online, contact the seller and if needed, **escalate to PlayStation customer support representatives** who have tools to further troubleshoot redemption issues over live chat or phone. In rare cases, a card may need to be refunded or replaced if damaged or expired. Always get proof of the issue in case a claim needs to be filed.
### Staying safe when purchasing digital gift cards online
The internet has made buying gift cards more convenient than ever but it's also introduced new risks. When shopping for digital PlayStation codes on third party websites or via emails instead of directly from PlayStation or major retailer sites, use caution. Only purchase from reputable marketplace sellers with a history of positive reviews to help ensure you receive legitimate codes. As a test, consider buying a smaller denomination card first before committing to a larger amount. Be wary of deals that seem "too good to be true" as these could be a sign of a compromised seller. If unexpected charges appear on your payment methods later, promptly contact your bank or credit card company to dispute them. Overall, choosing trusted established retailers is the safest bet for obtaining properly activated gaming gift cards.
