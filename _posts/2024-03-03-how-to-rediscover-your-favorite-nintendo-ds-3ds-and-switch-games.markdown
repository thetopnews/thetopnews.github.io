## Part 1: Rediscovering the Magic of Downloadable DS Games  
### **Revisiting Classic Downloads from the Nintendo DS eShop**
The Nintendo DS saw the introduction of downloadable games to the portable Nintendo platform. For those looking to revisit classic DS titles, it's still possible to rediscover some digital gems directly from the Nintendo eShop on a Nintendo 3DS or 2DS system. Here are the step-by-step instructions to redownload DS games:
1. Power on your Nintendo 3DS or 2DS system and launch the Nintendo eShop from the Home Menu. 
2. Select "Nintendo DSiWare" or "DSi Shop" from the eShop categories menu. 
3. Browse through the DSiWare game library to find titles you previously downloaded. 
4. Any games you previously purchased can be redownloaded for free by selecting the download button. 
5. Keep in mind that save data for DS downloadable games is stored on the actual game card or via an external save management application, so your progress won't transfer between systems. But it's a great way to rediscover classic DS downloadable titles.

### **Touchscreen Puzzlers and Retro Hits from the DS Era** 
A few **DS downloadable game** recommendations to rediscover include: Dr. Mario Express, a challenge-based puzzler that takes advantage of the DS touchscreen; WarioWare: Touched!, a frantic microgame compilation showcasing creative mini-games; and Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, a puzzle-platformer with level editor that extended the life of this portable classic well after the DS era. Whether seeking a challenge, creative diversions or blasts from the past, the Nintendo DS eShop maintains access to some enduring virtual gems.
## Part 2: Managing Digital and Physical 3DS Game Saves 
### **Saving Your Progress Between New and Pre-Owned 3DS Systems**
Managing save data is an important consideration for those hoping to transfer digital or physical games between Nintendo 3DS systems. Here's a overview of save data management between 3DS consoles:
1. For digital 3DS titles purchased via the Nintendo eShop, save data can be transferred to a new system by performing a system transfer. 
2. This transfers all associated digital purchases, save data and software over to the new console. 
3. Physical 3DS game cards store save data either internally or on the console's microSD card depending on the game. 
4. To transfer physical game saves, remove the microSD card from the old system and insert it into the new 3DS. This allows newly inserted game cards to access the previous save data. 
5. Keep in mind save data cannot be transferred between multiple systems, only in the process of a one-time system transfer to a single new console.
### **Longterm Favorites with Preserved Progress**
Two longstanding 3DS franchises with supported save transfers include **Animal Crossing: New Leaf** and **Pokémon**. In Animal Crossing, the internal game save is tied to the physical cartridge, allowing island residents and progress to move between systems. Meanwhile, Pokémon games store unique save files on the microSD for transferring Pokémon between new owners. Proper save management opens the door for players to revisit beloved digital and physical 3DS classics on new hardware.
## Part 3: The Touchscreen Revolution of the Nintendo DS 
### **Dual-Screens Ushered in a New Era of Portable Gaming**  
The launch of the Nintendo DS in 2004 marked an innovative leap that transformed what was possible on a handheld gaming device. Featuring dual 3.0-inch screens connected by a hinge, the DS brought touchscreen interactivity into the mainstream of video games. It pioneered features like the touch panel, built-in microphone, and compatibility with wireless multiplayer that became standard in the years since. Standout launch titles like Nintendo DS Browser and Nintendogs demonstrated how developers could harness the untapped potential of its dual-screen design.
### **Defining Innovation and Creativity in Handheld Gaming**
Over a decade into its lifespan, the Nintendo DS platform is still actively played and developed for thanks to homebrew programs and emulators. Iconic games like New Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, and Professor Layton pushed boundaries by breaking conventions and capitalizing on newfound interactivity. The DS Lite and DSi hardware refreshes improved ergonomics and usability. To this day, the platform's innovation leaves an indelible mark as a defining era of mobile gaming accessibility and creative problem-solving seldom seen since.
## Part 4: M-Rated Masterpieces Hidden on Handhelds
### **999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors**  
The 2010 Nintendo DS visual novel 999 from Chunsoft set a new standard for mature storytelling on a handheld. Players control an amnesiac man named Junpei as he's trapped on a sinking luxury liner with eight other hostages. Using puzzles and dialogue choices, the branching narrative builds an atmospheric mystery full of mature themes and plot twists. Its moody soundtrack and dark story combined with the portability of DS made it a cult classic, since ported to smartphones over a decade later.
### **The World Ends with You: Fighting for Your Life in Shibuya**
Released in 2008, The World Ends with You combined beautiful anime visuals with an innovative dual-screen battle system on the DS. As Neku awakens in the Underground of Shibuya, players explore the bustling city streets while partnering with various allies in visceral life-or-death battles. Its mature plot examines deep themes around individuality and human connection against a backdrop of peril. With top-notch music and stylish presentation, TWEWY stands out among the DS library as a uniquely memorable JRPG experience.  
### **Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars - Crime Fiction on the Go**
While most are used to open world mayhem on consoles and PC, the 2009 DS entry in the iconic GTA series pulled it off seamlessly on Nintendo's handheld. As young gangster Huang Lee, players navigate the criminal underbelly of Liberty City through drug deals, heists, and violence. Its top-down aesthetic translated the signature franchise chaos in a compelling portable package. With satirical writing addressing mature subjects, GTA: Chinatown Wars became a surprise hit that still satisfies on long commutes today.
## Part 5: Additional Classics to Discover
### **Survival Horror in the Palms of Your Hands** 
Beyond the aforementioned titles, the 3DS library maintained the DS tradition of mature hidden gems. The Resident Evil Revelations collection and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D ports brought survival horror and stealth thrills to Nintendo platforms. For a suspenseful Japanese experience, the Zero Escape series mixes visual novels with escape room-style puzzles in mature mysteries like Zero Time Dilemma and Virtue's Last Reward.
### **Fighters Made for the Move**
Fighting fans were also treated to varied brawlers on 3DS like Pokkén Tournament, a technical Pokémon arena fighter. Nintendo published ARMS, a inventive boxing game capitalizing on switch motion controls. And classics like Street Fighter IV 3D Edition and Tekken 3D Prime Edition brought iconic roster to the portable arena. With such a diverse assortment of mature genres, it's clear handhelds offer hidden experiences worth rediscovering.
## Part 6: The Cloud Saves Conundrum on Switch 
### **Digital Dilemmas in an All-Digital Age**
While the Switch continues Nintendo's handheld legacy, one lingering issue is lack of internal or external save management options for digital games. Unlike other platforms allowing backup saves to microSD cards or USB drives, Switch save data remains exclusive to each system's internal storage. If a console is lost, stolen or experiences hardware failure, digital purchases and hundreds of hours' progress can be erased permanently. 
### **Call for Official Cloud Saves Support**
With no way to manually backup or transfer saves, disappointed consumers have called on Nintendo to implement official cloud saves support through Nintendo Switch Online as found on other consoles and PC platforms. This would allow save data syncing between the internal memory and online servers. While some publishers like Call of Duty independently offer their own save cloud options, universal saves backup remains a glaring omission limiting digital-first Software on Switch.
### **Potential Solutions from Nintendo** 
Whether by coordinating with third parties, tweaking Switch Online benefits, or developing their own official solution, there is hope Nintendo will eventually address this issue troublesome for digital-focused players. In the meantime, physical game cartridges remain the sole option keeping cherished saves reliably backed up locally. However, the popularity of indie games and digital convenience emphasize demand for better online backup options going forward.
