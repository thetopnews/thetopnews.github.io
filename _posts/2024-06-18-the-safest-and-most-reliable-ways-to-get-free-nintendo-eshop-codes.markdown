### Earning Rewards Legitimately 
There are several trustworthy platforms that offer Nintendo eShop codes as rewards for completing tasks like surveys, watching ads, and playing games. **Microsoft Rewards** is a well-known example. By simply using Bing for searches orMicrosoft Edge as your browser, you can accumulate points that can later be redeemed for gift cards. Another reliable option is **Swagbucks** - you earn "Swag Bucks" by watching videos, taking surveys, shopping online, and more which can then be cashed in for codes from top retailers including the eShop. Branded Surveys is also a popular choice that rewards participation in market research surveys with options for digital currencies. While these methods require some time, they guarantee you will receive valid codes from the programs themselves.

### Entering Official Promotions and Giveaways
Nintendo frequently runs contests and giveaways directly on their own social media profiles and website where Nintendo eShop codes are among the prizes. By following Nintendo pages on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, you can stay informed of these verifiable opportunities. Even their official site occasionally hosts sweepstakes or contests where entrants can win codes. Keep an eye out for qualified chances to enter legitimate promotions run straight from the source.
### Redeeming Rewards from Purchase History  
Through their **My Nintendo** program, Nintendo offers points based on qualifying game and console purchases that can later be redeemed for prizes. Within the My Nintendo store, you'll find options to cash in your accumulated gold points for codes adding funds to your eShop wallet. While this requires previous expenditures, it allows you to get something back from Nintendo directly based on your verified purchase history with them.
### Signing Up for Special Offers and Deals
Subscribe to Nintendo's various email newsletters and you'll be among the first to learn about promotional codes, discounted pre-paid card bundles, and other limited-time offers available straight from the company. For example, around major holidays they sometimes offer subscribers the chance to buy discounted "Select-Your-Own" packages with multiple codes inside at a bulk- purchase price. Staying on their mailing lists ensures you don't miss out on these legitimate deals.    
### Avoiding Scam Code Generators
There are some websites that claim they can instantly provide you with free Nintendo eShop codes. However, these should always be avoided. In reality, many of these "generators" are simply ad-filled pages used by hackers to steal users' personal information like credit card numbers. Some may even install malware on visitors' devices. The truth is there is no such thing as a legitimate code generator - so protecting yourself means steering clear of any sites making impossible promises of free currency with no work required.    
### Being Cautious of Online Marketplaces
While third-party code resellers can sometimes offer discounted Nintendo currency, safety varies widely between different platforms. Only utilize well-established marketplaces that require strong seller and transaction verification processes. For example, reputable options include Amazon - as they vet sellers and have robust buyer protection policies. However, be wary of personal exchanges or unsecured sites, as dishonest individuals may sell compromised or invalid codes there. When using any code marketplace, practice standard online safety procedures.
### Ignoring Misleading "Instant Rewards" Offers   
Advertisements and pop-ups promising large sums of free Nintendo eShop funds given instantly should always raise red flags. Offers that seem too good to be true usually involve deception or inappropriate data collection attempts. No legitimate opportunity will provide currency without any required action on your part. By avoiding clicking such impossible "get rich quick" style promotions, you can protect your personal information and device security. It's never worth the risk to engage with or compromise yourself for anything claiming effortless currency.
### Following Basic Online Safety Guidelines
Remember - when it comes to earning or obtaining digital codes and currencies, genuine programs are verified and transparent about how rewards are gained. Legitimate platforms won't demand extensive private details without reason or sensible precautions. In all online activities related to codes, use secure passwords, avoid entering financial info unless a site is fully trusted, and be wary of requests for unnecessary access. Simple security habits go a long way in enjoying virtual content safely.
### Prioritizing Authentic Methods for Positive Gaming
By using the proven techniques discussed such as rewards apps, official giveaways and special offers directly from Nintendo, one can access new digital games and experiences through the Nintendo eShop without risking money, accounts or personal information. With some initial time investment and adherence to online safety basics, you can explore the library of Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS titles responsibly through authentic reward redemption. Overall just be sure to vet any opportunity thoroughly and avoid incomplete promises that seem dubious - this will lead to satisfying gaming through legitimate free code acquisition.
