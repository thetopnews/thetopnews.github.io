### Physical vs Digital Game Purchases
When purchasing games for the Nintendo Switch, there are two main options - physical game cartridges or digital downloads from the Nintendo eShop. **If you opt to buy a physical game cartridge**, the game's license and ability to play is tied directly to that specific cartridge. You'll need to keep the cartridge inserted in your Switch in order to launch and play the game. **Purchasing games digitally allows you to download the full game files directly to the console's internal memory or an attached microSD card**. In this case, your ability to play the game is tied to your Nintendo account rather than a physical cartridge. One notable difference is that physical game purchases allow you to easily resell, lend, or return the game once you're finished with it. Digital purchases prevent this level of control since the game is permanently tied to your account.

### Playing Without the Game Cartridge Inserted  
For physical Switch games that come on game cartridges, **removing the cartridge while the software is open will immediately close out of the game**. You won't be able to continue playing once that cartridge is ejected from the Nintendo Switch's card slot. However, for games you've purchased and downloaded digitally through the Nintendo eShop, **there is no requirement at all to keep the game cartridge inserted** once the game has fully downloaded and installed to your system. You can launch, play, and enjoy digitally downloaded Switch games freely without the presence of any game cartridge.
### Determining if a Game is Fully Downloaded
Even if you see a game's icon appear on your Nintendo Switch home menu, it doesn't necessarily mean that game has fully downloaded and installed from the eShop. One way to confirm whether the full digital download is in place is by attempting to launch the game. **If it prompts you to insert the associated game cartridge, that's a sign the download is not yet complete.** However, once the full game data has transferred and installed without needing the cartridge, **you can safely assume that game is entirely downloaded and can be played independently without requiring the physical cartridge**.
### Exceptions for Games Requiring Extra Downloads
While most digital Switch games constitute a complete download of all necessary game files, some exceptions do exist. **For select physical game releases, a partial game download may be included on the cartridge while additional content needs to be downloaded.** In these cases, you can typically access some early levels or gameplay modes prior to finishing additional downloads, though **the full game experience may be locked until those supplemental files are installed**. It's an interesting compromise that still ties playability partially to the cartridge while allowing online updates to expand the overall package over time.
### Testing Whatâ€™s Physically on the Cartridge 
Since physical Switch game cartridges provide at least some initial on-cartridge content before optional downloads, it can be insightful to examine what developers chose to include directly on the ROM chip versus making available through later patches. **By playing a new physical title enough to trigger any prompted additional downloads and then purposely avoiding installing them, you can get a sense of how "complete" the initial on-cartridge build actually is.** Does it cover just the opening hours or provide a sizable chunk of the full experience before downloads? Each developer likely takes a different approach, making it entertaining to see how they've structured on-cartridge versus downloadable content.
### Downloads Don't Guarantee Access
While downloading supplemental data for physical Switch games may expand what's playable, it doesn't override the requirement for the associated game cartridge. **Simply downloading extra missions or levels won't independently allow continuing to access those additions without keeping the initial cartridge inserted.** The full game files still need to be present, whether on the cartridge ROM chips or contained within an completely installed digital download, in order for the Switch to run that software without interruption. Partial game downloads don't negate the cartridge necessity established by the on-cartridge foundation.
### Comparing Benefits of Physical vs Digital Formats
Both physical game cartridges and digital downloads have their pros and cons for Nintendo Switch gaming. **Purchasing physical releases provides benefits like easily reselling or trading in titles you've finished with as well as lending games to friends**. However, digital purchases exchanged those perks for a far more convenient solution that doesn't require constantly swapping cartridges or worry about losing or damaging physical media. **With digital, your whole library is always immediately accessible right from the Switch menu without any cartridge management.** For some players, those digital conveniences outweigh sacrificing resale potential. But physical media also preserves some ownership benefits in a purely digital landscape.
### Summary of When a Game Cartridge is Required
To succinctly cover the core topic, here are the main scenarios regarding when a Switch game cartridge insertion is necessary:
- **For any physical game purchase on cartridge**, that specific cartridge must remain inserted in order to launch and play the game. 
- **With digital game downloads from the eShop**, as long as the full game files have completely transferred and installed, no game cartridge is needed to access that title going forward.
- **Partial downloads accompanying certain physical games may allow some initial gameplay before completing additional file transfers**, but full uninterrupted access still links back to requiring the associated cartridge or 100% download installation.
While exceptions do apply, those guidelines capture the standard experiences of relying on physical game cartridges for purchased cartridge games versus having fully downloaded digital titles independent of any cartridge needs.
### Exceptions for Games with Downloads and Access Limits  
As mentioned, a handful of Switch games blur the lines somewhat by including limited on-cartridge content that can be experienced before completing extra downloads. Two prominent examples are **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** and **DOOM (2016)**. Both titles contain beginning areas and gameplay modes on the cartridge, but mandate additional large downloads to access all regions, missions, and features. **Interestingly, these optional downloads never truly negate the cartridge requirement entirely.** Even after transferring terabytes of supplemental data, inserting the original game card remains necessary to run the full software packages seamlessly whenever you power on your Switch. So while downloads augment physical games, they don't replace the core function served by the included game cartridges.
