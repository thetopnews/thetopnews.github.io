### Multiplayer Gaming Requires an Internet Connection 
The majority of **multiplayer online video games** simply cannot be played without an internet connection to connect players from around the world. Games like **Fortnite Battle Royale**, **Call of Duty: Warzone**, and **Multiplayer** modes in **EA Sports titles** like **Madden NFL** and **FIFA** all require a steady internet connection to participate in the core multiplayer gameplay against other human opponents online. These titles are designed from the ground up primarily for online multiplayer experiences, so attempting to play them offline is simply not possible due to their fundamental reliance on internet connectivity to function properly.

### Most Single-Player Games Can Be Played Offline
In contrast, the vast majority of single-player focused video games do not require an internet connection to enjoy the core gameplay experience. Titles like **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**, **God of War**, **Red Dead Redemption 2**, and many others are fully playable and complete without any online connection whatsoever. Players can fully complete these game's stories, explore open worlds, overcome challenges and objectives entirely offline. The big-budget narrative experiences and solo adventures in these titles do not mandate ongoing online connectivity in order to partake in their main gameplay loops and progress.  
### Check for Online Requirements Before Purchasing
While single-player games are often able to be played offline primarily, developers are increasingly including **optional online features or multiplayer modes** in titles across all genres. So prior to purchasing any specific video game, it is highly recommended to double check whether there are any online components or connectivity requirements by researching the game's product details, reading reviews, and checking developer websites and FAQs. Checking for online requirements upfront prevents the disappointment of bringing a game home only to find out it cannot be started without an active internet connection.
### Updates Improve Experience But Are Not Always Necessary
Nearly all modern video games released in the last several years are designed to be frequently updated post-launch via patches deployed over the internet. These updates aim to squash bugs, fix errors, balance multiplayer, and even add new content on an ongoing basis. As convenient as they are, updates are not always absolutely essential to still enjoying a game, especially for its core single-player portions. While the most up-to-date versions ensure the best and most polished experiences, the fundamental gameplay loops, stories, and major features will still function without applying all of the latest patches for many titles.
### Multiplayer-Focused Games Oftentimes Require Regular Connectivity 
Games that position multiplayer as a primary mode or significant component tend to need online connectivity more often than purely single-player games. Titles like **Fortnite**, the **Call of Duty** series, and popular live service games with ever-evolving online modes rely upon frequent internet access in order to stay current with new seasons, maps, modes and rewards rolling out on a regular basis. They aim to keep players engaged through a consistent stream of fresh multiplayer content delivered over time. As such, these types of titles really require periodic online access to get the full intended experience.
### Features Like Cloud Saves Utilize Internet But Are Not Mandatory
While not always essential for core gameplay purposes, many modern titles also implementOPTIONAL internet-reliant quality-of-life features for added player convenience. Popular examples include cloud save functionality that automatically syncs a player's game progress to remote servers for easy access across different devices and platforms. Other extras such as global leaderboards, in-game marketplaces and multiplayer invasions can enhance some games but are not strictly necessary to complete them. These kinds of supplements presume and benefit from an active internet connection, yet doing without them still allows for fully experiencing the meat of the gameplay offline if needed.
### Patching Ensures the Best Possible Gaming Experience 
To conclude, an internet connection is absolutely crucial for participating in multiplayer-centric video games with consistent online functionality. However, the massive majority of single-player narratives, adventures and experiences can still be thoroughly played and enjoyed in their entirety even without applying any post-launch updates. While keeping games fully patched wherever possible optimizes performance and squashes bugs, the core entertainment provided by big-budget story campaigns remains relatively intact offline. As long as the core mechanics are not outdated too severely, solo gamers need not feel they cannot play at all without consistent online connectivity. Though, checking requirements for specific titles is still prudent before making any purchases.
