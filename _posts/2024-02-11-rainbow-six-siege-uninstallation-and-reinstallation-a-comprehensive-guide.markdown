## Part 1: Uninstalling Rainbow Six Siege from Steam
### Removing the Game Files
To fully remove Rainbow Six Siege from your Steam library, it's recommended to use the uninstall option within Steam. This will delete all game files from your system. **To uninstall through Steam**:
1. Launch the Steam application and log into your account. 
2. Click on "Games" in the top navigation menu, then select "Library" from the dropdown.
3. Right click on Rainbow Six Siege in your game library. Select "Uninstall" from the context menu. 
4. Confirm the uninstall by clicking "Delete" on the popup window. Steam will now remove all game files.

### Retaining Your Ubisoft Account
While uninstalling through Steam removes the game itself, it does not delete your Ubisoft account linked to the game. Any **operator and skin purchases, progression, and stats** are tied to your Ubisoft account, not your Steam installation. When you reinstall, simply log back into your existing Ubisoft account to restore all your **previously unlocked in-game content**.
## Part 2: Uninstalling Rainbow Six Siege through Windows
### Finding Rainbow Six Siege in the Control Panel 
If you prefer to uninstall Rainbow Six Siege through Windows instead of Steam, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel by clicking the Start button and typing "Control Panel" in the search. 
2. Click on "Uninstall a program" to access the full list of currently installed apps.
3. In the list of programs, find "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" and select it. 
4. Click the "Uninstall" button to begin removing the game and its files from your system.
### Ensuring Full Removal  
Compared to the Steam uninstall, using the Windows uninstall **may not fully remove leftover game files** in some cases. It's recommended to manually remove leftover folders after using the Windows uninstall to make sure Siege is **completely wiped from your drives**.
## Part 3: Uninstalling a Non-Steam Version 
### Finding and Deleting Game Files
For users who purchased Rainbow Six Siege directly from Ubisoft instead of through Steam, the uninstall process is a bit simpler. Follow these steps:
1. Locate the folder where Siege was installed, usually under Program Files or in your user documents folder. 
2. Backup any **saved games, weapon skins, or customization files** you want to keep.
3. Delete the entire Siege game folder to remove the installed files from your system. 
### Scouring for Leftover Files
After deleting the main game folder, it's a good idea to thoroughly search your system for any leftover config files, logs, or remnants of the installation. Use Windows Search to find strings like "Rainbow Six" or "Siege" and delete matches. This ensures a full and **clean removal without file remnants**.
## Part 4: Reinstalling Rainbow Six Siege
### Reinstalling on Steam  
If you originally installed Siege through Steam, reinstalling is effortless:
1. Launch the Steam client and log into your account.
2. Navigate to the Steam Store using the menu or store button.
3. Find Rainbow Six Siege in the listings and click "Install" to begin downloading. 
Steam will handle verifying your game license and restoring any **previously owned content** like operators, skins, and statistics. No extra steps are needed besides the download.
### Reinstalling Elsewhere
For non-Steam versions, you'll need to obtain a fresh install installer, usually by downloading from the Ubisoft website or through a purchased disc/code. Run the installer like any other program and log into your existing Ubisoft account. This will recognize your **purchases and progression history**, restoring your Siege profile fully.
## Part 5: Customizing Game Sensitivity in Rainbow Six Siege 
### Experimenting is Key
When starting in Siege, spending time adjusting sensitivity settings is crucial for precise aim and control. Most pros recommend a **medium-low sensitivity** of 15-30 cm/360°. However, ideal settings vary greatly by player, so it's best to experiment. Spend hours in training adjusting sensitivity up/down in small increments to find your perfect fit.
### Sensitivity Fine-Tuning 
Once you settle on a baseline sensitivity, the tuning process is ongoing. As your skills progress, revisiting settings ensures optimal control at all levels of play. Advanced players often separately tune horizontal/vertical sensitivity or zoom sensitivity. Take notes on how sensitivities affect your aim so tiny adjustments lead to constant improvement.
### Sensitivity Resources 
Outside of experimenting on your own, leverage the experiences of veteran players. Experts have analyzed optimal sensitivity settings in great detail. Reading guides can speed up your learning process and help decide where to set sensitivity for specific in-game situations. Comparing your settings to top pros' can also provide a useful baseline.
## Part 6: Practice and Improvement Strategies in Rainbow Six Siege
### Mastering Gunplay in Training Grounds
When starting out, dedicating many hours to perfecting gun mechanics alone is essential. Drill hard by completing missions on Training Grounds that emphasize recoil control and headshot accuracy. Master each weapon at long and short distances with single-fire and full-auto. Once gunplay feels second nature, you'll perform much better in matches.  
### Casual Play to Hone Skills
Once you feel ready to test skills against other players, stick to Casual modes exclusively at first. Focus entirely on practicing specific techniques like crosshair placement or anchoring sites. Review any gameplay to identify weaknesses and set clear goals, like flank watch or breach execution. Constant self-assessment leads to steady, measurable improvement over time.
### Incorporating Advanced Tactics
As you develop mastery over core abilities, delve into higher-level operator tactics and strategies used by competitive players. Study pro matches to learn optimal setups, plant positions, and round execution. Try incorporating new techniques a little at a time during Casual until they become second nature. Slow, methodical practice is key to implementing advanced competitive play.
## Part 7: Preparing for Ranked Play in Rainbow Six Siege
### Absolutely Mastering Casual Play
Never jump into Ranked until you’re dominating consistently in Casual. This means routinely getting MVP status, clutching rounds, and rarely dying in the first few seconds of a round. Ranked introduces consequences like deranking that new players can easily avoid by patiently learning in lower-pressure modes.
### Balancing Fragging Ability and Support 
While practicing headshots obsessively gives an edge in aim duels, Siege is rarely won through sheer firepower alone. Focus on **also improving** techniques like droning, communication, roam clear, and playing the objective—abilities tied more to winning than K/D. A well-rounded player able to both frag out and support teammates will excel highest in the ranked grind.
### Understanding the Ranking System 
Siege’s TrueSkill system considers far more than just wins and losses. Factors like individual performance, skill disparity between teams, and overtime rounds all influence changes to MMR (ranking points). Losing a single match early on may sting emotionally but rarely impacts long-term ranking. Maintain a calm mindset focused on constant self-improvement over short-term results.
## Part 8: Managing Stress and Maintaining Persistence in Rainbow Six Siege 
### Taking Breaks to Avoid Burnout
Even the most dedicated players need periodic breaks to recharge. When on long losing streaks or frustration mounts from toxic players, it’s best to step away for a while rather than suffer a mental breakdown on camera. Vent frustrations through exercise, hobbies or other games instead of emotionally compromising your Siege play.
### Changing Perspective to Stay Positive 
Losses will happen frequently, even to champions. Rather than self-blaming, view each as a learning experience to analyze later on video. Compliment enemies on good plays to diffuse tilt. Shift focus from purely chasing wins to instead improving specific skills each session based on replay reviews. A growth mindset keeps the game fresh and frustration at bay. 
### Maintaining Perspective on Progress  
Remember most players have been grinding Siege for years to reach elite skill. Patience and small daily improvements are far smarter goals than trying to catch up overnight. Take pride in each new ability or technique you develop rather than constantly comparing to pros. Enjoy celebrating all milestones, however minor, to maintain motivation over Siege’s long learning curve.
## Part 9: Accessing Community Resources for Continuous Improvement in Rainbow Six Siege
### Siege Content Creators on YouTube
Some of the biggest learning resources come from top-level educational Siege channels. MacieJay, VarsityGaming and others produce extremely detailed guides breaking down maps, operators and competitive strategies. Their videos on positioning, aim duels and round strategy provide endless free practice material.
### Finding a Supportive Squad  
Regular 5-stack play vastly improves the Siege experience and skyrockets learning. Join a community Discord to find dedicated players around your skill level looking to team up and grind together long-term. Having teammates to review mistakes with and learn new concepts from is invaluable for accelerating improvement.
