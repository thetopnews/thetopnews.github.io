### Understanding the PlayStation 5 and Laptop Display Technologies
The PlayStation 5 (PS5) relies solely on HDMI connections to output video and audio to displays, while laptops generally use proprietary display panel connections and integrated graphics chips. To connect a PS5 to a laptop, we must understand the core technologies involved. 
The PS5 outputs video and audio exclusively through HDMI ports, with no support for alternate display connections like LVDS or eDP commonly found in laptops. **Laptop display panels** integrate directly onto the motherboard and rely on dedicated **internal display connectivity** standards rather than HDMI. This means a direct connection without any conversion is not possible.

### Adapter Options for Connecting HDMI to Laptop Displays
While a direct connection is not feasible, adapters exist that can bridge the technological divide between HDMI and laptop displays. The most common options are HDMI to VGA, DVI or DisplayPort adapters. These passive converters can transmit the HDMI video signal but result in some quality loss due to signal conversion. 
For higher quality conversions, **active signal converters** are available that can adapt HDMI to eDP or LVDS, preserving the native resolution and bandwidth of the HDMI signal. However, **active converters** suitable for gaming are uncommon and expensive, often costing several hundred dollars. Compatibility also depends on the laptop's specific display connection and whether its integrated graphics can hardware decode the converted signal.
### Technical Challenges for a Direct Internal Connection  
Even with appropriate converters, significant technical hurdles remain for direct internal connection. HDMI outputs a much higher voltage than the low-voltage LVDS or eDP standards inside laptops. Directly connecting an HDMI source risks damage. 
Laptop displays also require **dedicated control circuitry and driver chips** integrated into the motherboard to handle functions like brightness, contrast and power management. Game consoles like the PS5 lack these display controller functions expected by laptop panels. Significant engineering modifications would be needed within the laptop itself to recognize and support an HDMI video source.
### Alternate Setup Options for Connecting a PS5 to a Laptop
While a direct internal connection faces insurmountable challenges, there are still ways to view PS5 games on a laptop through alternate setups. One option is connecting the PS5 to an **external monitor** using HDMI, and placing that monitor near the laptop. Video streaming applications also allow viewing PS5 games remotely on the laptop screen over the home network.
Services like **PS5 Remote Play** stream both gameplay video and audio from the console directly to Windows and macOS devices, including laptops. Latency is improved versus traditional video streaming with features like high-bandwidth local networks and proprietary codec support. For true console-quality gaming on a laptop, Remote Play is often the best performing solution compared to convoluted direct connection methods.
### Conclusion - Adapters Provide Limited Connection but Alternate Setups Are Easier
In summary, directly connecting a PlayStation 5 to a laptop's internal display is not feasible due to fundamental technological differences between HDMI and common laptop panel connections like LVDS and eDP. 
While video signal adapters exist that can bridge this divide, they result in visual quality loss and many laptops may lack hardware support for the converted signals. Significant engineering changes would also be required within the laptop itself. 
The best options are using the PS5 with an **external display connected** to the laptop, or leveraging **remote play functionality over the home network** to stream games without a direct physical connection between the devices. These alternate setups provide console-quality gameplay on a laptop without workarounds or compromises in quality from convoluted direct connection methods.
In the end, while not strictly possible via a plug-and-play internal connection, there are still convenient ways to view and play PS5 games through a laptop through alternative connection options.
