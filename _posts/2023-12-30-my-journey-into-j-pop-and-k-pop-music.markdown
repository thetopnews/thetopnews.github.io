## Discovering J-Pop Through Aoyama Teruma 
Back in 2012, I was first introduced to Japanese pop music, or J-pop. At the time, I didn't know much about music genres outside of American pop. One day, I heard a catchy song playing while watching a YouTube video - it was "Nandomo" by Aoyama Teruma. The upbeat melody and Teruma's sweet vocals immediately grabbed my attention. I was intrigued by the unfamiliar language yet found the song incredibly **uplifting Japanese pop ballad**. From then on, I started exploring more J-pop artists and songs. Teruma's "Nandomo" will always hold a special place as my first introduction to the vibrant world of J-pop.
### Expanding My J-Pop Horizons
After being hooked by "Nandomo," I began actively searching for similar Japanese artists online. This led me to popular Japanese idol groups like AKB48 and Keyakizaka46. I was fascinated by the large number of members and their energetic live performances. In particular, AKB48's song "NEW SHIP" stood out to me with its inclusion of an **Indonesian JKT48 trainee**, representing the international reach of J-pop. I also discovered ballad groups like Crystal Kay and FictionJunctionYUKA, admiring their emotive vocal styles. This marked the beginning of my passion for J-pop genres like idol and city pop. J-pop opened my eyes to a thriving music scene across the ocean.

## A Casual Encounter with K-Pop Through IU's "Blueming"   
While diving into J-pop, I was also exposed to some Korean pop songs without even realizing it. In 2017, the melody of IU's "Blueming" would get stuck in my head each time it played during commercial breaks on TV. At the time, I didn't know the singer or that it was a K-pop song. It wasn't until a friend started sharing her new interest in BTS that I learned more about the world of K-pop. When she mentioned "Blueming," I was surprised to discover it was a Korean song I had heard many times before. This casual, early introduction planted the seeds for me to explore **upbeat Korean pop ballads** in the future.
### Taking a Deeper Look into BTS
My friend recommended I check out some BTS songs after telling her about hearing "Blueming." Their energetic track "DNA" immediately caught my attention with its addicting melody and dance breaks. I was impressed by the group's tight synchronized choreography and catchy lyrics. This piqued my curiosity to learn more about BTS and the K-pop phenomenon sweeping the globe. Diving into more of their consistently high-quality discography, I was awe-struck by their vocal talents, music production and passion for their craft. BTS truly sparked my full-fledged interest in Korean pop music and its vibrant culture.
## Expanding My Horizons Through Japanese-Korean Collaboration
As an avid fan of both J-pop and K-pop by this point, I was thrilled to discover cross-cultural collaborations between Japanese and Korean acts. Honey Popcorn's "De-aeseohsta," featuring fully Japanese members singing in Korean, was an especially unique find for me. Their upbeat blend of J-pop and K-pop styles showed the positive cultural exchange happening. I also loved seeing Japanese idol groups cover K-pop songs at concerts or on variety shows. This highlighted how the industries were influencing and inspiring each other. Witnessing such collaborations further expanded my musical horizons and appreciation for East Asian cultures. The boundaries between J-pop and K-pop seemed to be dissolving into a rich tapestry of Asian pop.
### Appreciating Crossover Artists Like TVXQ! 
TVXQ!, now known as Tohoshinki in Japan, is one act that perfectly embodies the crossover between Japanese and Korean music. As one of the pioneers who helped spread the Hallyu wave, the group achieved success in both countries with hit songs like "Mirotic" and "Bolero." They blazed the trail for K-pop idols to establish Japanese fanbases and activities. TVXQ!'s incredible dancing, vocal talents and massive international fanbase is still hugely respected today. Exploring their illustrious career reinforced my love and admiration for musicians breaking barriers between nations through music. TVXQ! will always have a special place in my heart as icons of Asian pop collaboration.
## My Ongoing Love and Appreciation of J-Pop & K-Pop
Nearly a decade since first discovering J-pop, my passion for Asian pop shows no signs of fading. I keep up with new releases and comebacks from favorite acts while uncovering talented indie artists. Live concert experiences watching synchronized dancing and vivacious fan chants are soul-enriching. On a broader level, I've grown to respect how the cultures have influenced each other for mutual growth - whether through musical styles, fashion or tech advances. Asian pop continues to be a source of comfort, inspiration and community for me worldwide. While music trends come and go, the positive impact of J-pop and K-pop on my life will remain forever. I look forward to enthusiastically supporting the thriving scenes for many years to come.
