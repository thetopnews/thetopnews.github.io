Playing PlayStation games on a computer provides flexibility and convenience. Whether you want to engage with others while gaming or multi-task between work and play, there are several effective methods. This article explores the top options for streaming or viewing your PS5 gameplay on a Windows PC. 
## Remote Play with Low Latency 
### **Stream PS5 Wirelessly with Remote Play**
Sony's Remote Play feature allows you to stream your PS5 to Windows or macOS computers over WiFi. To set it up, follow the quick instructions at https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/ps5_win.html. The app lets you control your PS5 through your computer in a window. While Remote Play provides a free way to play PS5 games anywhere, the wireless connection can introduce input latency. To minimize lag, use a strong 5GHz WiFi network close to your console.

### **Reduce Remote Play Latency through Ethernet**  
For the lowest possible latency with Remote Play, connect your PS5 and PC to the same router via ethernet cables. A wired network eliminates interference that wireless signals face. You may still experience slight latency from streaming, but it will be better than relying solely on WiFi. Use the ethernet option for competitive multiplayer games where quick reaction time matters.
## View PS5 Gameplay with Minimal Input Lag
### **Capture Gameplay with a Hardware Capture Card**
A capture card takes the HDMI output from the PS5 and shows it on your computer through USB or Thunderbolt. Top cards like the **Elgato 4K60 Pro** offer high-quality 60 fps recording and near-zero latency passthrough. Plug the capture card into your PS5 and PC, then use streaming software like **OBS Studio** to view and record gameplay. Many streamers prefer this setup for its consistency and performance.
### **Dual Monitor Setup for Lowest Possible Latency** 
Connecting your PS5 directly to one monitor while using a second monitor for your PC results in virtually no input lag. It allows you to play PS5 games on the main display yet still have easy access to other desktop apps, web browsing, or work. Mount both displays next to each other for a clutter-free multi-monitor gaming station. This dual screen solution is ideal for those who prioritize responsiveness above all else.
## Additional Options for Viewing PS5 Remotely  
### **Built-in TV Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and Picture-by-Picture (PbP)**
Newer 4K TVs have built-in PiP or PbP modes that let you view one HDMI input as a smaller inset window while using the main display. Some advanced TVs even offer split-screen functionality across inputs. Check your model's settings to see if it supports simultaneously showing the PS5 and another device. The small window size limits use cases but provides a free multi-tasking view.
### **Stream PS5 Games Live on Twitch and YouTube** 
Use a capture card or Remote Play to stream your PS5 gameplay directly to platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Viewers can then watch your live broadcasts from any device that supports the sites. Being able to monitor chat and see viewers' feedback in real-time enhances interactivity. Streamers gain exposure and potentially earn income from streaming next-gen games to engaged communities online.
### **Play PS5 Games Remotely on Mobile with the App**
Sony's free PlayStation Remote Play mobile app extends PS5 streaming beyond computers. Play select PS4 and PS5 games from your phone or tablet anywhere there's a stable internet connection. Controls take adjustment on a touchscreen but work well for less precision-focused titles. Remote Play Away lets you continue games on the go during breaks from home.
## Additional Considerations 
All methods for viewing PS5 on PC require tradeoffs between convenience and performance. Hardware capture cards provide top-quality viewing but add financial cost. Meanwhile, Remote Play allows free remote access though latency rises compared to a physical connection. Newer gaming monitors with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) help minimize minor stuttering from input delays as well. Overall, match your use case priorities like responsiveness, budget, or mobile access with the optimal solution.  
## The Best Overall Solution: Dual Monitor Setup
For most gamers, a dual PC and console monitor configuration provides the best overall experience connecting a PS5 to Windows. It delivers smooth, lag-free gameplay at home exactly as intended by developers. And the second screen grants productive multi-tasking without disrupting immersive sessions. Mounting both screens ergonomically simplifies switching focus between work and play. While adding a second monitor requires more desktop real estate, it represents the most versatile long-term setup for enhanced PS5 PC usage.
