## Choosing Your Building Style 

There are two main styles to consider when building a home in Minecraft - modern or rustic. Modern homes have clean lines, symmetrical designs, and use blocks like stone, glass, and concrete powder. Rustic homes have a more organic feel, incorporating wood, stone, and foliage into their builds. Consider which style suits your vision before starting to gather resources.

## Gathering Resources and Tools

### Materials Needed

To begin construction, you'll want to stock up on basics like wood planks, logs, cobblestone, glass panes, doors and other essential building blocks. It's also useful to have water buckets, ladders, and torches on hand for functional details. Be sure to pack crafting tables, furnaces, and other tools for building and resource processing as well.
