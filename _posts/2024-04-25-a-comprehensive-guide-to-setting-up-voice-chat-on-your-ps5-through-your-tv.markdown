### An Introduction to PlayStation 5 Voice Chat Functionality 
The PlayStation 5 offers immersive 3D audio for games, but voice chat is limited to its DualSense controller by default. **This multi-part guide will provide a step-by-step process** for enabling voice chat audio output through your TV, allowing you to chat with friends while still hearing game audio through your television's speakers. We'll cover adjusting audio settings, properly configuring headsets and parties, addressing potential issues, and using third-party communication apps.

### Connecting Your Headset to the DualSense Controller
To begin, you'll need to pair a compatible headset to your DualSense controller. Supported headsets will have a 3.5mm audio jack. Simply plug the headset into the port located at the bottom of the controller. Ensure the headset is detected by verifying the audio output is routed through it in your PS5's audio settings. **This establishes a connection between the headset and controller for chat functionality.**
### Setting Your TV as the Audio Output Device
Navigate to the PS5's main settings menu and select 'Sound' then 'Audio Output.' Here you can choose the device that processes game audio. Select 'HDMI Device (TV)' as the default output. Now your TV will receive both game audio and voice chat audio signals from the PS5. **Proper configuration of audio output devices is essential for routing chat to your television.** 
### Forming a Party and Testing Voice Chat 
From the PS5 home screen, access the 'Parties' section and start or join a chat party. Invite some friends to join you. Within the party, you should be able to chat with others seamlessly while hearing both conversation and gameplay through your TV speakers. Take a moment to confirm chat is working through the television for all participants before playing games together. **Establishing a party is necessary for utilizing voice communication features on PS5.**
### Ensuring Proper Connection and Configuration
Once you've configured everything, double check that your TV is successfully receiving audio from the PS5 by viewing the audio information screen in the console's settings. Test chat functionality within a private party by speaking with invited friends. Should any issues occur, verify all connections are securely in place and audio output is set correctly. **Thorough testing is important to validate everything is performing as intended.**
### Using Third-Party Communication Apps 
While platforms like Discord do not natively support routing chat audio through the television, workarounds exist. Purchase a headset splitter cable that connects to both the controller and a audio/microphone headset jack on your TV. Launch Discord on the PS5 and attach other end of the splitter to your PC or mobile device. Now both Discord chat and game audio will output simultaneously through the television. **Adapters provide continued flexibility when necessary.**
### Potential Problems and Their Resolutions
One common issue is the audio output reverting back to the controller if the headset becomes disconnected at any point. Ensure the headset is securely plugged in when in use. Additionally, consider locking the audio output device selection in the PS5's sound settings menu so it does not change unintentionally. Batteries dying mid-game or weak wireless signals can cause intermittent cut-outs, so wired connections are recommended when possible. **Anticipating problems leads to preparing solutions.**
### Conclusion and Call for Feedback 
With a PlayStation 5, DualSense controller, compatible headset, and television, unlocking wireless voice chat is straightforward. Just follow these steps to configure audio devices and parties.
