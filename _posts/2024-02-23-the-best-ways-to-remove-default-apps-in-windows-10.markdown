### Introduction 
Windows 10 comes preinstalled with many default applications that some users may find annoying or unnecessary. Microsoft intentionally designs these apps to be difficult to remove to control the user experience. However, there are **several potential options** to uninstall default apps to **optimize storage space** and customize your system. This guide will explore **different methods** for safely removing default applications in Windows 10.

### Use a Cleaning Utility 
Specialized PC cleaning utilities like **IObit Uninstaller** allow for the safe removal of default apps. These programs have **extra functionality designed to circumvent the protections** put in place by Microsoft. IObit Uninstaller and similar tools display all installed programs on your system and allow you to select the default apps you want to remove. With a single click of the "uninstall" button, the program will attempt to delete the app while addressing any blockades implemented by Windows. Cleaning utilities provide an easy **graphical user interface (GUI)-based solution** for deleting default apps. 
Using a cleaning tool usually involves downloading and installing the program, then selecting the preinstalled apps you want to delete from the list. **IObit Uninstaller** and comparable programs work to bypass Windows' defenses by terminating processes and deleting registry keys associated with the default applications. However, there is still a small risk of potential issues, so it is recommended to create a restore point beforehand.
### Enter Safe Mode
Booting into Safe Mode is a reliable **troubleshooting technique** that starts Windows in a very basic state, ideal for removing stubborn programs. Safe Mode loads only essential drivers and files, circumventing many third-party obstacles. To access Safe Mode, restart your PC and continually tap the F8 key during startup until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears. Then select "Safe Mode with Networking" and press Enter. 
Once in Safe Mode, open Programs and Features from the Control Panel and inspect the list of installed apps. You may find that certain default programs can now be uninstalled by right-clicking and selecting "Uninstall." Some examples include 3D Builder, Studio, and Get Help. Safe Mode's simplified environment defeats many of the usual blockades preventing removal. Reboot normally after uninstalling to complete the process. 
Using Safe Mode requires physical access to the PC but provides a software-based solution without additional downloads. It allows evaluating default programs one-by-one for removability in a protected environment. For users uncomfortable with third-party utilities, Safe Mode offers a straightforward Microsoft-supported alternative.
### Use the Troubleshooting Tool
As the creator of Windows 10, Microsoft provides built-in troubleshooting capabilities aiming to address various issues users may encounter. One such tool is the Apps and Features Troubleshooter designed to offer solutions for problems related to application installation and uninstallation.
The Apps and Features Troubleshooter can be accessed from Settings or by searching for "troubleshoot" in the Start menu and selecting "Troubleshoot settings and problems." Click on "Additional troubleshooters" and then "Apps and Features." Follow the on-screen prompts, which may involve restarting your device. The troubleshooter analyzes your system configuration and attempts to identify and resolve any obstacles preventing the safe removal of default apps. 
While there are no guarantees, running this troubleshooter is a simple option that leverages Microsoft's backend diagnostic abilities without third-party dependencies. It evaluates apps on an individual basis, removing blockades which could allow previously undeletable defaults to be uninstalled through the standard Apps and Features interface. For those averse to experimenting in Safe Mode, this built-in tool provides an initial direct solution worth exploring.
### Consider a Custom Windows Distribution
For users seeking the most thorough approach, a viable option is installing a lightweight "custom build" of Windows optimized for minimal bloatware. One such option is Tiny10, a distro engineered from the ground up with a focus on stripping out unnecessary default programs entirely.
Tiny10 is an independent rebuild of the Windows 10 operating system done in partnership with various PC optimization experts. It removes all preinstalled apps,unused frameworks, and vendor customizations during installation. This provides a clean "factory fresh" Windows environment tailored for performance without any resource-draining defaults. Additionally, Tiny10 incorporates tweaks to enhance privacy, security, and productivity. 
Installing Tiny10 guarantees there will be no unwanted preloaded applications to irritate or slow down the user. Compared to troubleshooting removal on a standard Windows build, Tiny10 sidesteps all issues by omitting bloatware and optimizing the OS from the start. For those seeking the purest Windows experience or building a new system, this type of custom solution ensures the permanent absence of intrusive default programs.
### Conclusion
Many users understandably want full control over their device's software by removing default applications included by Microsoft. This goal remains challenging due to built-in protections, but safe solutions do exist for optimized installations. Cleaning utilities provide an accessible GUI option, while booting into Safe Mode allows uninstalling certain programs through standard Windows tools. Additionally, using the Apps and Features Troubleshooter or installing a customized build like Tiny10 potentially delivers more thorough resolutions. With patience and by exploring these various approaches, it is possible to curate the ideal Windows experience customized to an individual's preferences and hardware resources.
