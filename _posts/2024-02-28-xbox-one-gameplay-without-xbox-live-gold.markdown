## Playing Games Without an Xbox Live Subscription
Xbox One allows gamers to enjoy content from their library without requiring an Xbox Live Gold membership for certain single-player and local experiences. Here are some of the ways players can get the most out of their games without a paid online subscription.
### **Play Disc and Digital Games Without Limitations**
The Xbox console does not restrict the playing of disc-based or digitally downloaded games in offline or local multiplayer modes. Owners can insert disc games and begin installation to access core single-player content **or cooperative gameplay with friends in the same room**. For digital titles, simply launching the game from your library will start the adventure. An Xbox Live Gold membership is unnecessary to experience these game features.

### **Huge Story Campaigns in Blockbuster Franchises** 
Some of gaming's most acclaimed franchises contain dozens of hours of immersive storytelling perfect for enjoying alone. Story-rich games like **Assassin's Creed**, **Battlefield**, **Call of Duty**, and others are focused on delivering memorable adventures that do not require an online component. Players can dive into these rich narratives and fully understand the plot of the latest entries without an Xbox Live membership.
### **Massive Sandboxes Beckon Solo Explorers**
Vast open world games invite gamers to get lost in their virtual environments without the chaos of online multiplayer. Titles such as **Watch Dogs**, **Tomb Raider**, **Horizon Zero Dawn**, and others provide seemingly endless landscapes filled with hidden locations, activities, and missions for those looking to quietly unravel their secrets alone. An Xbox Live Gold subscription is unnecessary for climbing towers, completing side missions, and taking in the breathtaking sights on your own schedule.
### **Build Your Dream Racing Career** 
The **Forza Motorsport** and **Forza Horizon** franchises deliver robust racing experiences without going online. Their career modes allow building a car collection, gaining fans, and perfecting driving skills through hundreds of events and challenges. Players can curate the perfect roster of vehicles for solo road and track adventures across gorgeous open worlds while progressing through the ranks of each game's online systems offline to enjoy for many hours.
### **Local Co-op Fun for the Whole Family**
In addition to solo enjoyment, the Xbox provides opportunities for co-op couch gaming without an internet subscription through split-screen and local wireless play. Titles with this support let gamers relive campaign co-ops and versus modes together right in their living room. Family-friendly options abound in genres like racing, sports, fighting and more empowering enjoyable shared experiences for all ages together at home.
## An Optional Subscription 
While online access enhances select games, Xbox One gameplay retains much of its value locally. Gamers can feel confident playing their disc and digital libraries without the need for an Xbox Live Gold membership to experience campaigns, casual sessions and time with family and friends together in person. The subscription offers more features, but is by no means mandatory for basic gaming enjoyment on the console through solo and offline co-op play of many popular titles.
