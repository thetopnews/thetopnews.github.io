### **Avoid Missing Out With Automatic Updates** 
Connecting your PS4 to a stable internet source and enabling automatic updates is the simplest way to keep Fortnite up-to-the-minute on PlayStation 4. Navigate to **Settings > System Software Update** and tick the box next to **“Download Updates Automatically”** to allow your console to automatically download and install any new system or game updates in rest mode or when powered on. This hands-off approach prevents you from missing critical bug fixes or new seasons that require the most up-to-date software version.

### **Proactively Check for Updates at Your Convenience**
Even with automatic downloads enabled, you may wish to manually check for updates at your leisure. Highlight Fortnite from your games library or home screen and press the **Options** button. Select **"Check for Update" and the PS4 will verify if the latest version is installed**. If an update is available, you can download it immediately rather than waiting for your next play session. Checking proactively ensures you never find yourself unable to play online or access new content due to an outdated game client.
### **Monitoring the Update Installation Process**  
Once an update is initiated, your PS4 will download the necessary files and begin installing them. You can keep tabs on the progress from the notifications panel. Leave your console in rest mode or switched on overnight if needed for larger updates to fully complete in the background while you sleep or are away. **Avoid interrupting the installation by powering off your system prematurely**, as this could potentially corrupt files or leave your game in an unstable state. 
### **Get Notified of Critical Updates Within Fortnite**
Even when automatic downloading is enabled, Epic's development team pushes essential patches frequently that require acknowledgment. Upon launching Fortnite with a new update ready, you will receive an in-game notification prompt to install the latest version. Tap the on-screen button to confirm the download rather than continuing to play on an outdated build vulnerable to exploits. Regularly checking for these pop-ups ensures your experience stays protected and optimized.
### **Remotely Trigger Downloads From Anywhere With Your Mobile Device**  
The PlayStation App gives you remote access and control over your PS4 when away from home. After signing in, browse to Fortnite in your game library and tap the **“Download to PS4”** button to kick off an update installation, even if your console is currently in rest mode. This convenient feature means the newest patch will be ready by the time you power on to play, no matter your location. The ability to trigger downloads on the go ensures your system is always up-to-date with a single click.
### **Factory Resets Won't Erase Your Epic Games Account or Progress**
Initiating a system restore and wiping your PlayStation 4 hard drive back to factory default settings does not delete any tied **Epic Games account data or in-game purchases, levels, and stats accumulated over many seasons of play**. Re-downloading Fortnite after a reset will automatically restore your entire profile stored safely in the cloud. So don't fret about losing precious cosmetics, Battle Pass progress or V-Bucks if you need to reinitialize the operating system for any reason. Your Epic profile is forever preserved independent of your device.
### **Staying on the Cutting Edge Safeguards Your Experience**  
New Fortnite updates are continuously improving every facet of the game. Substantial patches squash bugs, reinforce security vulnerabilities and introduce fresh seasons packed with both major and minor feature additions. Ensuring you always have the most up-to-date version installed, whether through automatic downloads or manual checks, is key to an optimal gaming experience free of connection issues or patch incompatibilities with other online players. Keeping your game client on the cutting edge protects and enhances your Fortnite experience with every new release.
