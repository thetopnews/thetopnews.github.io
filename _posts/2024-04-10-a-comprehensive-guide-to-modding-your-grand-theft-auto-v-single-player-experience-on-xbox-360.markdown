### **How Rockstar Views Modding and the Risks Involved**
While Rockstar allows **modding the single-player campaign** of their Grand Theft Auto titles, they strictly prohibit any modifications from being used online where it could negatively impact other players. Given the outdated hardware of the original Xbox 360, there are few ongoing features for GTA Online on that platform anyway. Most importantly, using **unauthorized mods or hacks online** on any system risks receiving a permanent ban on your account. For the best modding experience within Terms of Service, stick to modifying only your solo games on Xbox 360.

### **Accessing the Full Suite of Story Mode Features**  
To access all of the story mode beyond the initial tutorial, you'll need an active Xbox Live Gold membership. This paid subscription opens up options like **customizing your character** at clothing stores and tattoo parlors, purchasing property, and participating in side activities around the sprawling city of Los Santos. Thankfully, a one month Xbox Live Gold pass is very affordable to test out some basic mods.
### **Unpacking the Limitations of an Ung jailbroken Console**  
Without hard modding the system through an intricate process known as "jailbreaking", the original Xbox 360 cannot run unsigned code or access low-level system files. This limitation means **complex mods are impossible** without extensive technical know-how. Moreover, "jailbreaking" an Xbox voids the warranty, and risks console bans if the mods are used maliciously online. Stick to approved mods that don't require jailbreaking for the safest experience. 
### **Accessing Infinite Cash and Health with Save File Modding**
One option available to Xbox 360 owners is modifying their game saves with a PC application. Save editors enable toggling **god mode** to prevent character death and give access to **unlimited money** to buy all assets in single player. The editor allows adjusting game stats like strength and driving skill too. This is a simple way to empower the offline story mode experience within the console's restrictions.
### **Downloading the Free Grand Theft Auto V Save Editor**   
Head to GTAinside.com, the top destination for GTA mods, and search for or navigate to the GTA V Save Editor page. Click the download button to save the application file to your computer. This editor is regularly updated by its developers to remain compatible with the latest game versions. It's important to only download the editor from trusted sources to avoid malware.
### **Installing and Opening the Save Editor Program**
Once downloaded, locate the save editor installation file and double-click to begin setup. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation. No special skills are required. The intuitive interface makes modifying saves very straightforward. Launch the program and you'll see options and sliders to tweak every element of your in-game character build and experience.
### **Customizing Your Save File with God Mode and Money**
The most useful options for new players and modders on a closed console are found under the "Modifier Tools" tab. Here you can toggle infinite health / god mode using a slider. You can also max out the cash amount counter at $99,999,999 for an endless money supply in story mode. Don't forget to click "Save Changes" to finalize the edits before exiting and loading the customized save on Xbox 360. 
### **Transferring Modded Saves to Your Console**  
To use the modified save file, simply save it to a USB flash drive in the correct folder structure. Eject the drive and plug it into the Xbox 360 to copy the save over to the console's internal storage. Load up GTA V story mode from the pause menu and your optimized character will be ready to play with unlimited options and zero risk of losing progress due to deaths. Let the carnage ensue!
### **Maximizing Your Xbox 360 Modding Experience**  
With the right tools and approach, you can push your GTA V experience way beyond the base game limitations within the rules set by Rockstar on the aging Xbox 360 system. Hopefully this guide provided you the necessary information to start modifying saves safely. Feel free to experiment with different stat options or try more complex mods as your skills improve over time. Most of all, enjoy rampaging as an unkillable god of crime in Los Santos offline!
