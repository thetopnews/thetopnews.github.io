### The Golden Age of 2D Platformers on the Original DS
The original Nintendo DS saw tremendous success with 2D platformers that exemplified what made the genre so beloved. **New Super Mario Bros.**, released in 2006, showed that the handheld was more than capable of delivering the classic 2D Mario experience fans had come to know and love. Tight controls and carefully crafted level design held true to the formula that made prior Mario titles so instantly playable and replayable. Additional multiplayer and competitive modes provided extra gameplay incentives, but the standalone campaign highlighted how well the genre translates to a portable format. 
Nintendo and third-party developers capitalized on the DS's dual screen capability by utilizing the bottom touch screen for interactive gameplay elements. In **Yoshi's Island DS**, released in 2006, the bottom screen served as Yoshi's utility belt, allowing players to aim and throw eggs by touching designated icons. Similar touch-based mechanics enriched other 2D titles of the era like **Kirby: Canvas Curse** and **Trace Memory**. The dual screens emphasized the DS's uniqueness while retaining tried-and-true side-scrolling gameplay.

### Early Experiments with 3D Platforming on the Original DS
While the DS showed its 2D prowess, developers also experimented with 3D capabilities within the system's technical limitations. An early example was 2005's **Pac-Man World 3**, which brought the iconic character into a fully fledged 3D adventure. Rendering and framerate suffered compared to contemporary console versions, but it served as proof 3D was an attainable new frontier. Most third-party titles ultimately opted for a "2.5D" **isometric perspective** that prioritized performance over fully immersive 3D.
The Legend of Zelda franchise also dabbled in 3D with 2006's **The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass**. A fixed camera perspective allowed the game to render expansive environments and occasional cutscenes in true 3D. However, navigation relied on a 2D, top-down dynamic for optimal control. The hybrid 2.5D approach worked better than isometric or true 3D might have for the beloved adventure series on handheld hardware. While crude by modern standards, these experiments constituted valuable early steps toward more advanced 3D platforming.
### The Rise of 2.5D Design on DS 
So-called "2.5D" titles became the norm for platformers seeking to capitalize on the DS's dual screens without overtaxing its modest internals. Standouts included **New Super Mario Bros.** follow-up **New Super Mario Bros. 2** in 2012, **Kirby: Squeak Squad** in 2006, and **Donkey Kong Country Returns** in 2010. Avoiding fully 3D visuals balanced graphical fidelity and performance. Touch screen incorporation grew more creative thanks to lessons learned from prior titles. 
The Legend of Zelda franchise continued refining its 2.5D style. 2009's **The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks** expanded upon its predecessor's fixed camera with new locomotion mechanics using the stylus and microphone. While its top-down presentation felt familiar, multiplanar environments provided depth absent from side-scrolling 2D. This "2.5D" hybrid became the dominant design approach for platformers seeking to push graphical boundaries within DS hardware constraints. It set the stage for greater 3D potential enabled by successors.
### The Power of the 3DS Ushers in True 3D Platforming  
Nintendo took the dual-screen handheld concept to new heights with 2011's Nintendo 3DS. Boasting significantly more processing power, impressive **autostereoscopic 3D** screen technology, and expanded cartridge sizes, it enabled a leap forward for the genre. Platformers no longer had to compromise between 2D, 2.5D and 3D. Titles like **Super Mario 3D Land** brought the iconic plumber into fully polygonal, glasses-free 3D worlds. Near-photo realistic visuals would continue to be out of reach for some time, but the transition from sprites had begun.
### Mario Kart 7 Pushes 3D to the Limit
One of the most impressive technical showcases was **Mario Kart 7** in 2011. Its tracks spanned multiple planes with layers of textures and lighting unmatched on prior handhelds. Racers zoomed across intricate multi-tiered circuits that blurred the line between portable and living room experiences. While still less visually complex than console iterations, it proved the 3DS was a true dedicated gaming platform. The seamless mix of 2D and 3D, once a technical necessity, became an opportunity for more imaginative level design.
### Hybrid Approaches Define the Era 
Developers continued sharpening their skills at crafting memorable platforming experiences across 2D, 2.5D and 3D. **Kid Icarus: Uprising** blended on-rails shooting with adventure elements. **Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon** married polished 3D exploration with creative touch-based ghost catching. But perhaps no series better embodied the hybrid approach than Legend of Zelda. 2013's **The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds** blended side-scrolling 2D dungeons with an expansive 3D overworld, a marriage made possible through the graphical leap of the 3DS. Its bold art style allowed ample visual flourishes withinhardware constraints. This flexibility to incorporate multiple dimensions defined the platform.
### Pushing Boundaries with Xenoblade Chronicles 3D 
As the New Nintendo 3DS upgraded hardware in 2015, flagship titles tested its enhanced limits. None pushed further than xenoblade Chronicles 3D. Originally a Wii title, its ambitious open worlds and intense real-time combat seemed unlikely candidates for handheld form. Yet its portable release achieved the impossible - retaining the graphical splendor and scale of a home console RPG. Massive vistas stretched to the horizon, populated with enemies to battle on the go. While framerates chugged at times and textures couldn't match original specs, it redefined expectations and demonstrated the New 3DS's potential for console-quality experiences on the go.
### Endless User-Generated Content with Super Mario Maker 
As the decade drew to a close, one title kept 2D Mario fresh through perpetual community support - **Super Mario Maker**, released exclusively on Wii U but ported to the New 3DS in 2016. Its robust level-building toolset married the nostalgia of Mario's side-scrolling roots with the convenience and connectivity of touchscreen creation. Players could unleash their imagination across styles spanning decades, all sharable online. With a devoted community still generating millions of unique courses years later, Super Mario Maker epitomized gaming as a collaborative art form and ensured longevity for the 2D genre.
# A Hybrid Future for Portable Platforming
The arrival of Nintendo Switch in 2017 ushered in a new era of versatile portable gaming. Blockbuster multiplatform ports like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild finally allowed console-quality experiences completely unhindered by hardware. But more than graphical leaps, the Switch proved the viability of seamless transitions between stationary and mobile play. Its hybrid design laid philosophical groundwork for a blending of dimensions previously separated by static hardware categories. 
Looking ahead, portable platforming will likely continue evolving thanks to technological and conceptual fusion. Virtual and augmented technology may one day merge 2D, 3D and reality without barriers. Interactive storytelling could blend cinematic setpieces with sandbox playgrounds. And most importantly, gameplay first designed for living rooms may finally become accessible anywhere, anytime without compromise - a prospect that would have seemed impossible during the limitations of the original DS era. The hybrid future is one defined by potential rather than pipelines. Platforming without platforms lies on the creative horizon.
