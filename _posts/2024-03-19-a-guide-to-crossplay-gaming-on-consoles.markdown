### Crossplay is Growing Between Different Platforms
As video games become increasingly social experiences, the ability to play with friends regardless of their chosen gaming platform is becoming more important. Known as crossplay gaming, the functionality allows players on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC and mobile to join multiplayer matches and sessions together. While support has traditionally been limited between consoles due to business and technical reasons, pressure from gamers has led to more publishers enabling the option in recent years. This guide will outline how to enable and take advantage of crossplay in some of the most popular titles today.

### It Depends on the Individual Game
Not all games support crossplay right away or provide the functionality in the same location in their settings menus. Some, like the block-building phenomenon **Minecraft**, have had crossplay switched on by default since launch allowing players on different systems to seamlessly play cooperatively or competitively together. However, others require enabling the crossplay option manually which can vary based on the game and console. Players will need to check the specific settings menu for each title individually to see if crossplay is an option and where it may be toggled on or off if needed. 
For example, in the fast-paced hero shooter **Overwatch** on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, crossplay is enabled through the account section under general options and settings menu. Meanwhile, crossplay in sports racing title **Rocket League** appears as an option in the main menu under “Extras” regardless of the platform. It’s important for players interested in expanding their communities to take a few minutes exploring the individual settings of supported titles.
### Call of Duty Provides Leading Crossplay Examples
Two of the most prominent first-person shooter franchises, **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** from 2019 and its direct sequel **Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War**, set the standard for robust crossplay implementation across consoles and PC. In the 2019 title, players can locate the option to toggle crossplay on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 by heading to the main menu’s account section. There, a prompt will appear to link a Call of Duty account for tracking stats and enabling cross-platform play. 
A nearly identical process exists in Black Ops Cold War, with crossplay available from the start simply by linking a valid account. The option can be found under the menus’ “Account and Network” section. With a massive player population across platforms, being able to squad up with friends regardless of their hardware gives these yearly shooters staying power in between new entries. The seamless integration sets an example for other multiplayer games going forward.
### Fortnite and Rocket League also Provide Model Crossplay Experiences
In addition to Call of Duty, Epic Games’ free-to-play phenomenon Fortnite and Psyonix’ soccer stunt sequel Rocket League also deliver stellar crossplay support across all systems. Fortnite automatically prompts players through account sign up during initial set up, transparently linking profiles to enable cross-platform play and progression. No additional steps are needed in the settings. 
Rocket League displays the crossplay toggle more explicitly in its main menu under the “Extras” tab. Here, players on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC can opt to matchmake only against others using the same device, or expand the player pool globally for shorter wait times. Both titles delivered barrier-free crossplay long before it became standard, helping garner massive followings by bringing together friends everywhere to compete and cooperate.
### A Few Examples Still Lack Crossplay Functionality
While the largest multiplayer games now commonly support playing between all hardware, some publishers have been slower to implement crossplay for various business or technical reasons. Sports sim **NBA 2K**, long-running fighter **Mortal Kombat**, and open-world adventure **Red Dead Redemption 2** represent a handful of titles that remain locked to individual platforms. 
The lack of crossplay means friends can only face off or join co-op sessions if using identical hardware. This silos portions of these games' communities. However, as publishers realize gamers want to play together more than apart, we may see cross-generation and cross-platform support added to more legacy titles through future updates. Demand from players will likely be the biggest driver for expanding crossplay functionality where missing.
### Consider Input Differences and Communication Options
While the ability to link up across platforms opens massive potential player pools, there are a few considerations for those taking advantage of crossplay. Chief among them is input discrepancies - playing against PC players using mouse and keyboard versus controller users on consoles can create imbalances depending on the genre. 
Additionally, each system presents its own approach to voice and text chat. Parties, messaging, and squad features work differently between PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC. Making sure everyone is on the same page about communication is important for coordinated team play. Platform-specific features, performance, and potential connection quality differences between hardware are other minor factors to keep in mind when integrating friends from elsewhere into your gaming sessions.
### Larger Communities Through Crossplay Are Beneficial
On the other hand, the upsides of full crossplay functionality far outweigh any potential downsides for most players. With user bases combined across all devices, games are guaranteed to always have a thriving player population no matter when someone is looking for a match. Queue times become practically non-existent even for niche game modes.
Perhaps most valuable of all, crossplay erases previous boundaries that prevented gaming buddies from directly competing or cooperating together based solely on their hardware of choice. Whether playing different consoles in the same room or linking up online across great distances, the ability to squad up with anyone is a major benefit to the social aspects of multiplayer titles. 
At higher and professional levels of competition, larger potential pools of opponents thanks to crossplay also serve to sharpen skills for the most hardcore players. Everyone ultimately wins by gaining access to a much more massive community of fellow gamers to enjoy titles with for longer.
### Input Methods May Benefit From Balancing Tweaks 
While crossplay opens doors, the mixing of control schemes does raise questions around fairness based on input method advantages - particularly the precision and speed of mouse/keyboard over gamepad controls. Top players have voiced that lack of input based matchmaking can negatively impact the competiveness of matches in shooter and other fast-paced genres.
Publishers have taken varied approaches to address these concerns. Fortnite, for example, implemented separate aiming assist strength depending on input to level the playing field. Meanwhile, Call of Duty titles introduced the option to toggle crossplay off for a console-only experience. Overall balancing of aim assists, sensitivities and other factors will likely continue evolving on a game-by-game basis to find the right middle ground of fun and fair gameplay across inputs. 
For the everyday player, any perceived disadvantages are typically outweighed by sheer accessibility and social enjoyment that crossplay enables. But continued improvements safeguarding competitiveness at the highest levels can only further grow fan appeal and viewership of esports for multiplayer titles. Developers balancing these factors will set their games up for long term success.
### In Summary - Expand Your Community Through Crossplay
To recap, crossplay gaming has grown tremendously in popularity and support among major titles thanks to player demand and technical feasibility across modern consoles, PC and mobile. While not universal, this guide outlined how to access the option in some of today's biggest games as well as considerations around different platforms' input methodologies and communication approaches. 
The massive communities and competitive excitement built from one integrated player pool spanning hardware wins out versus any potential downsides crossplay could introduce. Take a few minutes to explore settings across your favorite multiplayer games - you may find features enabling much bigger communities to enjoy your favorites with. With continued refinement addressing fairness among inputs, crossplay's rising adoption promises much brighter social futures for online videogames.
