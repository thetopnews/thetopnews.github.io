### **Stream PS4 Games From Anywhere With a Unofficial Workaround**
Sony allows PS4 owners to stream and play their console games on PS Vita using Remote Play. However, the small screen and controls of the Vita can make some games difficult. Luckily, there is an unintended multi-step workaround that allows users to sync their DualShock 4 controller to their Vita to vastly improve the Remote Play experience. This guide will explain the process and limitations of using a DualShock 4 controller with Remote Play on PS Vita.

### **Set Up Secondary and Primary PSN Accounts**
To get started, you will need two PSN accounts - a primary account and a secondary account. This is required as the Vita can only be signed into one PSN account at a time for Remote Play. Be sure to create strong and unique passwords for both accounts for security. Once created, sign into the secondary account on your Vita. You may need to reformat your Vita's memory card if it was previously used for your primary account. 
### **Start Remote Play on Vita with Secondary Account** 
Launch the Remote Play app on your Vita while signed into the secondary account. Your PS4 may need to be reconnected as it will see this as a new device. This allows the Vita screen to be controlled remotely using the secondary account. 
### **Log Into Primary Account on PS4**
With Remote Play running on your Vita with the secondary account, turn on your DualShock 4 controller and log into your primary PSN account directly on your PS4 console. The PS4 fortunately allows for multiple accounts to be logged in simultaneously.
### **Sync DualShock 4 to Switch Screens**  
By keeping both accounts logged in concurrently on the PS4 and Vita, you can use the SHARE button on your DualShock 4 to seamlessly swap the Vita's Remote Play display between the two accounts. This lets you use the DualShock 4 to control games being streamed from your primary PS4 account.
### **Improved Gaming Experience with Dual Shock 4 Controller** 
Compared to the limited inputs on the Vita, using a DualShock 4 vastly improves gameplay. Its analog sticks, buttons, and responsive controls make **cloud gaming and remote play** a far more enjoyable experience, especially for action and shooter titles. You can now comfortably play games like Gran Turismo Sport, God of War, or Horizon Zero Dawn on a handheld.
### **Downsides to the Multi-Step Workaround**
While it allows DualShock 4 usage, there are still some constraints. You will need to reformat your Vita's memory card each time you swap accounts, which is tedious. The DualShock 4's connection range is limited to your local area network since it syncs directly to your PS4 rather than the Vita. Any **remote play lag or screen dimming issues** inherent to the Vita also still apply when using this method.
### **Conclusion - A More streamlined Solution is Needed** 
In the end, this unintended workaround gets the job done but requires extra steps and has limitations. While it greatly improves the control scheme, Sony should provide official integration between the PS4 and Vita to copy Nintendo's seamless controller connection in the Switch. A software update that allows direct Bluetooth/WiFi syncing of the DualShock 4 to the Vita for Remote Play would be the optimal solution without the headaches. Until then, PlayStation fans can employ this procedure to enjoy their console games on a handheld screen with a real controller.
