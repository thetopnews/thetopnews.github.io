## Using Bluetooth for a Simple Connection 
One of the easiest methods for connecting your Xbox controller to a PC wirelessly is through Bluetooth. **Bluetooth wireless technology** allows pairing supported devices together for synchronous data transmission over short distances. Most modern laptop and desktop computers come pre-installed with built-in Bluetooth connectivity, so no additional hardware is required. 
To connect your Xbox controller via Bluetooth, first ensure your PC has Bluetooth functionality enabled in the device settings. Then enter your controller's pairing mode by pressing the pairing button, usually located on the rear of the unit near the battery compartment. Next, search for Bluetooth devices on your PC and select your controller from the listed pairable devices. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete pairing. Once paired, your controller should immediately be recognized and usable with your PC wirelessly through Bluetooth. 
### Bluetooth Compatibility and Range 
Bluetooth supports connection distances of around 30 feet depending on obstructions. Line of sight is usually best although modern Bluetooth implementations can transmit through walls to a degree. Not all Xbox controllers feature Bluetooth, so check which models and generations include the functionality. Older models may require a separate wireless adapter instead. Bluetooth pairing also works across iOS, Android, Windows, and other operating systems for easy cross-compatibility.

## Using a Dedicated Xbox Wireless Adapter
If your PC does not have integrated Bluetooth, the next best option is to utilize an official Xbox Wireless Adapter. This small USB dongle retails for around $25 and plugs directly into any USB port on a laptop or desktop computer. Once installed, it allows wireless pairing of modern Xbox One controllers as well as older Xbox 360 controllers for lag-free gaming on Windows. 
### Setup and Pairing the Xbox Wireless Adapter
To set up the adapter, simply plug it into a USB port and allow Windows to automatically install any necessary drivers. Then place your Xbox controller into pairing mode by holding down the pairing button as indicated. The Xbox Wireless Adapter will display as an available device on your computer to connect with similar to a Bluetooth connection. Select your controller and follow the pairing prompts. In just moments you'll have a reliable wireless connection established without dealing with Bluetooth compatibility issues.
### Improved Wireless Performance 
Designed specifically for Xbox controllers, the dedicated wireless adapter provides lag-free performance equal or better than using Bluetooth. It maintains strong wireless signals through dense electromagnetic interference that can hamper Bluetooth. The adapter also supports simultaneous pairing of multiple controllers allowing cooperative local wireless multiplayer gaming right out of the box without additional configuration.
## Enabling Wake on USB in BIOS for Controller Wake Function 
A convenient feature available on many modern gaming motherboards and computers is the ability to wake the system from sleep using a connected USB device like an Xbox controller. To enable this capability, you must access the BIOS or UEFI settings during early startup before Windows loads. 
Restart your computer and press the designated key like Delete or F2 as it powers on to enter the BIOS configuration menus. Navigate to the Power Management or USB options and look for a setting labeled "Wake on USB" or something similar. Enable this feature which allows low-power USB ports to detect activity and wake the system. 
### Using a Wired Xbox Controller for Wake
Now with "Wake on USB" enabled, simply plug in your Xbox controller via its included USB cable. Even when your computer is in a low-power sleep state, pressing any buttons on the controller will power your PC on instantly so you can begin gaming without waiting for a full boot. This provides a seamless transition between sleep and wake using the controller as a remote switch.
### Limitations for Complete Power Down State
However, wake functionality only applies if the computer was last put into a sleep, standby, or hibernation mode rather than a full shutdown. The USB power must also remain active to detect button presses so this wake method exclusively requires a wired controller connection. Wireless adapters or Bluetooth do not currently support waking from a USB disconnected sleep state.
## Using Programmable Smart Plugs for Remote Power Control
An alternative solution for remotely controlling power from a distance without direct wired contact is to utilize smart plug technology. Smart plugs are WiFi enabled electrical outlets that can be programmed and controlled remotely using a mobile app or voice commands. 
### Setting Up Smart Plugs for Wake Functionality  
After installing a compatible smart plug between your computer and the wall outlet, download its corresponding app to pair and configure the plug to your home network. Then assign it to respond to commands through the app, Alexa/Google Home voice control, or IFTTT applet triggers. Common triggers include pressing an integrated button, issuing a voice command, or connecting to the local network on startup.
### Remotely Power Cycling with Smart Plugs
By power cycling the outlet your desktop is plugged into, the physical reset essentially "wakes" the computer in the same way pressing a restart button would. Now you have the ability to restart or wake your PC from anywhere with an internet or local network connection just by issuing a voice command or app button press to the smart plug even when fully powered down - though this is not as clean of a wake as pressing a controller button.
## Using Older Xbox Wireless Adapters for True Remote Wake 
While smart plugs provide remote power control, they fall short of allowing seamless waking via controller input like the USB wake method. For full wireless wake functionality matching a wired connection, an original older model Xbox wireless adapter released nearly a decade ago remains the only solution. 
### Identifying the Legacy Wake-Capable Adapter 
The adapter supporting wireless wake came packaged in a distinctive green cardboard box sporting the original "Xbox Wireless" branding before the product line was renamed under the Xbox brand. Other key identifiers are its more squared-off industrial design measuring roughly 3x2 inches in size compared to the newer slimmer models. 
### Wake Trigger Functionality Lost in New Revisions
Unfortunately Microsoft removed the ability for wireless wake triggering in all revisions of the adapter following the original legacy model. Even using USB battery packs on the newer units will not restore this convenient feature present on the first generation product. As such, finding an used older model is currently the single option enabling wireless wake input from controllers.
## Conclusion - The State of PC Wireless Wake Solutions
In summary, while various workarounds exist for connecting Xbox controllers wirelessly to PCs, a simple out-of-the-box solution remains elusive without certain technical limitations or older specialized hardware. Bluetooth provides easy pairing if supported, otherwise a dedicated wireless adapter maintains strong wireless performance at an affordable price. Enabling wake on USB allows controllers to smoothly wake a computer from sleep mode when plugged in directly. Meanwhile programmable smart plug technologies deliver remote power control albeit without clean controller wake input. Ultimately, true wireless wake triggering requires procuring an original legacy Xbox Wireless Adapter no longer in production, leaving room for improved universal solutions in the future.
