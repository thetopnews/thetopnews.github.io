## Part 2: **Stylish Anime-Inspired RPG with Life-or-Death Battles**
### The World Ends With You 
Released in 2008 by Square Enix, The World Ends With You takes place in the youthful and trendy neighborhoods of Shibuya, Tokyo. Players take control of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen teenager who finds himself competing in "The Reapers' Game", a mysterious battle for survival. Using both screens of the Nintendo DS creatively, combat plays out as "Battles" that require tapping, tracing, and timing-based actions on each display simultaneously. Partnering with new temporary allies every few days, Neku must learn to trust others and open his cynical heart to find the truth behind the high stakes Game. With its gorgeous anime art style and energetic soundtrack, The World Ends With You submerges players in a vibrant vision of Shibuya. Its poignant portrayals of self-discovery and forging relationships gave the Nintendo DS a sophisticated story-driven experience quite unlike anything else on the system.
## Part 3: **Open World Crime Thrills on a Handheld Console**  
### Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars
Released in 2009 by Rockstar Games, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars brought the notorious open world crime franchise to the Nintendo DS. Players take control of Huang Lee, a member of a Triad family who is framed for his father's murder. To clear his name, Lee must work his way up the criminal underworld of Liberty City via robbery, drug running, and gunfights through the detailed open city. While its top-down perspective lacks the first-person mayhem of home console editions, Chinatown Wars impressively recreated Liberty City's sprawling environments and diversions. With mature themes of violence, language, drug use and sexual content, it showed the Nintendo DS was not only for all-ages gaming. Its critical acclaim demonstrated handhelds were ready for mature-rated experiences that stayed true to fan favorite franchises.
## Part 4: **Groundbreaking Survival Horror that Pushed the DS to its Limits**
### Dementium: The Ward  
Released in 2005 by Renegade Kid, Dementium: The Ward was an early first-person shooter for the Nintendo DS that pushed the system's dual screen capabilities to their limits. Players assume the role of a amnesiac patient exploring the dilapidated Abbott State Penitentiary, encountering unsettling secrets and increasingly disturbing supernatural enemies. By utilizing tricks like independent camera control and inventory management between screens, The Ward established that true FPS gameplay was possible on Nintendo's handheld. With its unpolished-yet-unnerving atmosphere and grotesque creature designs, The Ward was also among the first Nintendo DS titles to embrace mature horror â€” showing the system was ready to frighten and disturb players of all ages.
## Part 5: **Enhanced Horror Sequel with Memorable Terrifying Environments**
### Dementium II
The 2005 sequel Dementium II, also developed by Renegade Kid, improved upon the original in nearly every aspect. With enhanced graphics powered by a new graphics engine, players navigated ever more disturbing environments within the abandoned Abbott State Penitentiary with revamped dual-screen first person shooter mechanics. New explorable areas like the Infirmary and Solitary Confinement Wing subjected players to creative horrors around every eerie corridor. Returning characters like Dr. Falkinstein were fleshed out with tragic backstories that added emotional depth. Most impressively, newly designed enemy types like the Crawlers and the Mutated proved even more unsettling than before, reliably inducing jump scares. With countless refinements and a more compelling narrative, Dementium II set a new standard for survival horror on the Nintendo DS and showed the franchise was here to stay.
## Part 6: Horrifying Zombie-Blasting Rail Shooter 
### Touch the Dead
Released in 2007 by Joymax, Touch the Dead embraced old-school zombie tropes to deliver arcade-style rail shooter zombie blasting action on the Nintendo DS. Across various environments like cities, sewers and forests, players tap and swipe on both touchscreens to gun down oncoming zombie hordes. A variety of firearms like shotguns and machine guns could be upgraded, and defensive items scattered to regain lost health. Though simplistic in design, Touch the Dead offered plenty of gruesome undead slaying thrills through its challenging and visually appealing gameplay. Perfect for playing in short bursts, it captured that satisfying zombie killing catharsis beloved of the genre. With its lighthearted but gory tone, Touch the Dead proved the Nintendo DS was not too kiddy for some good old fashioned brain splattering fun either.
## Part 7: **Classic Fatality-Filled Fighting on the Go**
### Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3
In 2006, Midway Games brought one of the most iconic and controversial fighting game franchises to the Nintendo DS with Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Bundled with the first three MK games, UMK3 adapted the series' signature fast-paced 2D combat seamlessly to the dual screen handheld. Famous fighters like Liu Kang, Kitana and Sub-Zero retained all their moves and special attacks from their arcade originals. Even the franchise's notoriously violent fatality finishing maneuvers stayed fully intact. Playing through the single player Tower mode or against friends both locally and online, UMK3 allowed portable mayhem. It proved mature content had a place on the Nintendo DS, and helped build the reputation of the system as accommodating to all kinds of gamers, not just children.
