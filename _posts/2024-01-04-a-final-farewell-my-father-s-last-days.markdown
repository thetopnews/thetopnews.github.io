### Saying Goodbye
It was a Thursday night in the middle of July. I was exhausted from chasing my four and two-and-a-half year old children around the house all day while nearing my due date with our seventh child. My husband was out of town for work. That night, I had promised the kids ice cream if they bathed and got ready for bed on time. We hurried to the local **dairy farm ice cream shop** but found it closed due to a personal tragedy involving someone from our church. As I drove home, I discovered the roads were blocked off by police. That's when I learned the devastating news: a young man from our church had murdered three teenagers in his basement after sexually assaulting them.

### A Shocking Revelation
I drove to a friend's house to find out more. There, I was told the horrific details of what happened. The young man had killed three girls with knives in his basement after making them watch him masturbate. When his innocent wife arrived home, he was agitated but wouldn't say why. They went to their Bible study leader's house, where the man suddenly shot the leader in the back before speeding away in his wife's car. Police found a list of potential targets at his home and sent church leaders into hiding. It was unfathomable that something so evil could happen within our close-knit church community.
### Saying Goodbye to My Father
Fast forward several months. I was caring for my elderly father in hospice as he neared the end of his life. Each day, we talked about his passing and what was happening on "the other side." One day, the doctor informed us he only had hours left. I sat by his bedside, **forgiving him for any past faults** and asking for his forgiveness in return. When he passed, I felt at peace, knowing my mother's spirit was welcoming him home. In those final moments together, my father truly showed me that dying can be a beautiful transition if you're surrounded by love. 
### Communicating from Beyond
In his last days, my father often spoke of communicating with spirits. He felt my mother's hand on his shoulder and could see the imprint of her fingers. As he slept, he'd talk to unseen presences. Sometimes he seemed confused about who was in the room. But his insights gave me comfort, proving that consciousness lives on after death. One night, he calmly announced that he and my mother were leaving this "earthly plane." I knew then that her spirit was guiding him into the next realm.
### Saying Farewell Through Stories
Spending daily hours by my father's bedside in hospice, I began recording our conversations. Looking back, those intimate moments we shared in his final days now feel like precious gifts. Telling stories of his life brought him joy. And for me, the memories have provided solace during the grief process. Though it's still hard to accept he's gone, I take comfort knowing his spirit is at peace with my mother's in whatever lies beyond. Our time together showed me that having someone there at the end truly makes all the difference.
### Finding Purpose in Pain
Caring for my father in his last days was emotionally and physically draining. But seeing him through to the other side brought me closure and a sense of purpose. Though his death left me deeply saddened, being present for family in their final hours has since become a personal mission. After witnessing the profound bond between my parents even after one passed, I now hope to offer that same comforting presence for others facing end of life. Seeing life and death's interconnectedness has greatly shifted my perspective. Even in suffocating sorrow, we can ultimately find meaning.
### Living on in Love and Memories 
It's been several months now since my father passed. Though the ache of missing him still lingers, over time the pain has dulled into a bittersweet nostalgia. Our family makes efforts to honor his memory through caring acts, donating to causes he supported, and regularly sharing fond recollections that make him feel still present among us. I take comfort knowing that as long as his story lives on through our memories and hearts, a part of him will continue **living on**. There is solace in believing the deep love shared between us transcends even death. His final lessons of compassion continue guiding me each day.
# Rekindling Purpose: Finding Light After Loss
My father's passing left me facing an uncertain future. Unsure of my next steps, I decided to volunteer **at a local hospice** to stay close to the work of caring for the dying. Through those experiences, I found community and comforting purpose. Interacting with patients and their families allowed me to process my own grief while helping others through theirs. Witnessing daily acts of empathy, courage and love has helped rekindle my outlook even in dark times. Though loss will always bear its scars, surrounding myself with humanity at its most vulnerable has shown me life's fragility and giftedness. Facing mortality has reignited my drive to make each moment meaningful and to contribute however I can to others' final journeys. While the pain of loss may never fully fade, in opening my heart anew to life's brevity I am learning to see light even beyond darkness.
