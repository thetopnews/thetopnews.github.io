## Part 1: Understanding Digital Game Licenses on Nintendo Switch
Digital games purchased through the Nintendo eShop are tied to a Nintendo account rather than the console itself. This allows players flexibility in transferring their digital library, but some limitations apply due to licensing restrictions. Let's explore how the process works. 
### **Transferring Digital Nintendo Switch Games**
Nintendo designates one console as the "primary" system linked to each account. **This primary console allows all user profiles to access downloaded digital titles without the purchasing account signed in.** To move this activation to a new system, some steps must be followed as outlined below.

## Part 2: Deactivating the Current Primary Console  
To begin the transfer process, the existing primary console must first be deactivated from that role. This ensures only one system remains actively primary for a given Nintendo account.
### **Accessing the Nintendo eShop Menu** 
From the Switch home menu, select the Nintendo eShop icon to open the digital storefront. Then navigate to your user account page in the top right corner.
### **Finding the Deactivate Option**
On your account information screen, look for the "Primary Console" section near the bottom. Select "Deactivate" to remove the primary status from the current Switch. 
### **Confirming Deactivation**
A prompt will appear asking to confirm deactivation. Select "Yes" and the console will be immediately deactivated as the primary device. This must be completed before setting up a new primary system.
## Part 3: Activating a New Primary Console
With the old primary Switch deactivated, any other Nintendo Switch console can now be designated as the new primary device.
### **Linking a Nintendo Account**  
On the target Switch, access the eShop and log into the Nintendo account that was used to purchase digital games. 
### **Setting the New Console as Primary**
The system will automatically detect it is not currently registered as primary and prompt to activate this status. Select "Yes" to make it the principal device.
### **Verifying the Console Change**
Return to the account information page in the eShop to check the "Primary Console" section now lists the new Switch as active. The transfer is now complete.
## Part 4: Re-downloading Previous Purchases
Once the target console is set as the new primary device, all digitally purchased titles can be re-downloaded from the Nintendo eShop using the same account.
### **Accessing the Nintendo eShop Homepage** 
Launch the eShop from the Switch home menu and sign into the associated Nintendo account. 
### **Viewing Previous Digital Purchases**
The eShop homepage will feature a section labelled "Your Purchases." Selecting this displays all previously bought digital games.
### **Re-downloading Game Titles**  
Simply find the desired game in the list and select the "Re-download" button to queue it up. Games will then install directly onto the new primary Switch.
### **Transferring Saved Game Data (Optional)**
While games can be redownloaded, **saved game data requires separate transfer using either local Save Data Cloud backup or a physical microSD card swap between systems.**
## Part 5: Playing on Secondary Consoles  
Any Switch not designated as primary can still access digital titles, but with certain usage limitations for non-purchasing user profiles.
### **Signing In on Secondary Consoles**
To play downloaded games on a non-primary Switch, the purchasing Nintendo account must be signed in. 
### **Profile Restrictions for Non-Purchasing Users**  
Unfortunately, other profiles created on the secondary console will be unable to access the digitally downloaded games library. 
### **Internet Connection Requirements**
A constant online connection is also needed on secondary systems to verify the active account's license when launching any purchased software.
### **Local Multiplayer Exceptions**  
As a benefit, local wireless or online multiplayer is still possible across different profiles when the purchasing account has the game open and accessible.
## Part 6: Repeating the Transfer Process
Owning multiple Switch systems enables taking games on the go. But to shift the primary activation, some steps need repeating as consoles change.
### **Deactivating the Current Primary**  
Just like the initial transfer, the most recently designated primary Switch must have its status deactivated in the eShop menu.
### **Setting a New Switch as Primary**
Accessing the eShop on another Switch allows linking the associated account and setting that console as the new active primary device. 
### **Automatic Retransfer Between Switches**
Subsequent moves between Switches are essentially the same reversible process - deactivate, activate on new device. This allows freely shifting the primary activation.
### **Avoid Leaving Consoles as Non-Primary**
For best experience and access, aim to always have one console active as primary rather than leaving multiple in secondary status indefinitely.  
### **Contacting Customer Support if Needed**  
Rarely, if a primary console is lost, Nintendo customer service may be able to help transfer the activation to a new system.
## Part 7: Additional Tips for Transferring Digital Games 
Some supplementary advice can optimize the transfer process and account security when shifting digital games between Nintendo Switch devices.
### **Back Up Save Data Before Each Transfer**
To avoid losing progress, back up all **game saves to the Nintendo Switch Online cloud or a microSD card prior to deactivating any primaries.**
### **Consider Changing Passwords Periodically**
**For enhanced security, change the associated Nintendo account password after fully completing each console transfer,** especially if an old system is being deactivated. 
### **Check Purchase History for Missing Games**
If titles seem missing after a transfer, double check the purchase history tied to the Nintendo account for games purchased on other systems.
### **Contact Support for Complex Issues**  
While the process is mostly straightforward, edge cases may require working directly with Nintendo's customer assistance for specialized help.
## Part 8: Conclusion
With a bit of planning and by adhering to Nintendo's policies, gamers can seamlessly shift their expansive Nintendo Switch digital libraries between multiple consoles for on-the-go gaming flexibility. While some restrictions do apply depending on devices' primary status, with care the vast majority of players can navigate transfers smoothly.
