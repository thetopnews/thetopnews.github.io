### Using a Licensed Wired LAN Adapter 
The **HORI licensed wired LAN adapter** made specifically for the Nintendo Switch plugs directly into the dock's USB ports using a standard USB A connection. This allows for a wired internet connection even when playing on the TV in docked mode. To use while undocked, a USB C to USB A adapter is required to plug the LAN adapter into the Switch itself. When selecting a third party adapter, ensure it is compatible with the Switch as support can vary.
The HORI LAN adapter provides a stable, high-speed connection for online gaming sessions. Measuring only a few inches long, it plugs discreetly into the dock without causing any clutter. Games load faster when using this **Nintendo Switch LAN adapter** compared to a wireless connection.
