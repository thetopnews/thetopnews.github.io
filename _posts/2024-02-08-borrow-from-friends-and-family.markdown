Getting a 3DS doesn't have to cost you if you expand your search to friends and family. Many people you know likely already own a 3DS and would be willing to **lend you theirs for a period of time at no cost**. Simply ask close friends or relatives if you can borrow their system to play some of your favorite games. You never know - someone may even offer to gift you their older model as an inexpensive present for your birthday or holidays. Maintaining strong social connections helps open opportunities for access to electronics you want without the heavy price tag.
### Shop the Secondhand Market 
The used market presents an affordable way to become a 3DS owner. Websites like **Facebook Marketplace and craigslist allow local selling** between individuals, so keep an eye out for previously enjoyed systems posted at reduced prices in your area. For a wider selection, consider browsing well-known online marketplaces like **eBay and Amazon Warehouse Deals featuring refurbished consoles sold by authorized resellers**. With some patience and luck, you're sure to encounter excellent pre-owned hardware at fair prices far below full retail cost through secondhand sources.

### Consider Prize Competitions and Surveys
If you enjoy a challenge, enter free-to-enter sweepstakes and online giveaways where the top reward is often a new gaming system. Sites like **Survey Junkie, Swagbucks and InboxDollars offer points redeemable for gift cards** after completion of various questionnaires, tasks and activities. Accumulate enough points, and you can turn them in for an eShop gift card to put towards digital games or even a full priced 3DS. It takes diligent participation, but contests provide a fun way to potentially receive a free system through chance.
### Scope Out Pawn Shops and Thrift Stores
When funds run low, expanding your local search to pawn shops and thrift retailers opens new pre-owned options. Value Village, Goodwill and Savers frequently stock a revolving selection of donated electronics, including older Nintendo handhelds at wallet-friendly costs. PawnAmerica, U.S. Pawn and Cash America Pawn also carry pre-owned game gear on consignment at discounted appraisal prices. Set aside time every couple weeks to tour stores in your area - you never know when a bargain 3DS may appear!
### Utilize Price Trackers and Sales Events   
Signing up for deal-hunting email lists and price-tracking websites alerts you to potential savings at major retailers. Sites like **CamelCamelCamel for Amazon and TrackerShark for Walmart notify of price drops** on specific items, so watch older 3DS models you're interested in. Holidays and back-to-school also bring promotions - keep an eye out during those seasons for enticing bundle offers with the system included at a reduced package price. Act fast when deals drop to snag an affordable 3DS.
### Consider Game Rentals from Local Libraries
Did you know some public libraries now **lend physical video games just like books?** Systems in their collections rotate regularly as titles checkout and return. See if any libraries near you partner with organizations like The Library Game to expand their offerings. With a valid membership, you could check out first-party Nintendo 3DS titles for free - an entertainment bargain that lets you experience top games without expense. Plus, no late fees if you return on time!
### Connect With Your Local Gaming Community  
Area comic/game stores and Facebook groups focused on local gaming provide an embedded community. Beyond just shopping, these hubs can connect you with others in your region also hunting deals. Members often arrange system **trades, sell older consoles or offer borrowing**. Getting involved in local meetups and tours of local gaming stores familiarizes you with what's happening in the secondary market. Who knows - you might find an open-box or like-new 3DS through community connections. 
### Consider Older 3DS Models
If your budget remains tight, don't forget about previous 3DS generations now selling used at low prices. The original 2011 3DS launched over a decade ago and remains fully capable of playing most retail titles, often at fractional current costs. Sleek hardware updates are nice, but not necessary - the 3D feature and home menu hold up just fine on earlier models. Sometimes the most affordable path involves settling for pre-owned older tech still completely functional for most core 3DS experiences.
