### Uniting Communities Across Platforms
One of the most exciting features of Minecraft on Nintendo Switch is its ability to unite players across different console families, PC and mobile platforms. Known as **cross-platform play** or **cross-play**, the Bedrock version played on Switch can connect to the same multiplayer worlds as Xbox One, Windows 10, iOS and Android users. This removes previous barriers that kept Minecraft communities separated by device. Friends with Xbox, PC or phones can now build and battle together in the same minecraft worlds regardless of what system they own. For the first time, the entire global Minecraft population is united in one shared play space.
### Joining and Hosting with **Realms Servers**
For dedicated group play, Minecraft Realms subscriptions provide persistent online worlds that can be accessed from any platform. Owners of **Minecraft Realms private servers** can distribute subscription codes to allow friends and family to join their maps anytime, from Switch or beyond. Alternatively, players can also visit publicly-listed worlds hosted by the wider Minecraft community across all systems. With Realms, players never need to worry if their friends are online at the same time - worlds remain open 24/7 for everyone on the whitelist to build and explore together asynchronously. 
### Four Ways to Play: Creative, Survival, Adventure & Mini-Games
Minecraft offers four primary gameplay modes on Switch to satisfy every type of player. Those wanting to focus solely on construction can choose **Creative Mode** which provides unlimited resources to build without survival stresses or risks. For a true challenge, players can select **Survival Mode** to craft tools, find food and shelter while battling hostile mobs at night. Alternatively, unique adventure maps created by other talented artists can be downloaded to experience detailed story-driven worlds in **Adventure Mode**. Lastly, community-designed mini-games offer competitive multiplayer modes for **PvP battles** and cooperative puzzle solving. No matter one's interests, Minecraft presents endless ways to play.
### Intuitive Controls Built for the Switch
Nintendo designed the user interface of Minecraft for Switch with flexibility and intuitiveness in mind. In handheld mode, movement and actions can be performed using the usual joystick and button controls. However, to truly leverage the Switch's hybrid design, the touchscreen can also be applied for easy inventory management, crafting or precise building placements too. Whether docked or portable, players will find familiar mechanics that have defined the franchise for years remain very accessible on Switch no matter the display. While buttons will forever have their place, the touch interface opens new doors for interaction that make the most of Nintendo's versatile device.
### Save Your Worlds Anywhere with Automatic Cloud Syncing 
One concern of a portable game system is the ability to access saved data anywhere without risk of loss. Minecraft on Switch elegantly solves this problem through automatic cloud syncing between devices. Any new buildings, resources or characters earned while playing in handheld mode will seamlessly sync to the Nintendo eShop **cloud saves** when an internet connection becomes available again. This means players can pick up right where they left off whether at home or on the go. What's more, profile data will transfer over should one also own Minecraft on Windows 10 or mobile to freely move a single player profile across platforms.
### Joining Community Maps on the Go 
Part of Minecraft's enduring appeal comes from the boundless user-generated content developed by its worldwide community. On Nintendo Switch, players can access this content anywhere through **community maps** and **mini-games** downloaded from online marketplaces. Browse curated adventures, puzzles or PvP arenas developed exclusively for Bedrock and play them instantly by connecting to WiFi. The most breathtaking constructions or intricate challenges from the PC community are now portable experiences. With an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription needed for online features, gamers have an entire creative universe at their fingertips anytime, anywhere.
### Is the Portable Edition Worth It?
For dedicated Minecraft fans or those seeking a definitive portable experience, the Nintendo Switch edition delivers incredible value. While lesser powered than gaming PCs, Switch hardware capably runs even thelargest community maps smoothly in both handheld and docked modes. More importantly, it preserves the full multiplayer and community content experience expected of Bedrock. Between bringing one's existing profile on the go or connecting with friends across devices, Switch Minecraft succeeds in transporting the quintessential block-building experience anywhere life may lead. For these reasons it remains one of the best options available to immerse in creative play or join worldwide servers wherever adventure calls.
### Building without Boundaries
In the decade since its initial release, Minecraft has grown into the best-selling video game of all time by empowering millions to construct their fantasies without limits. The Nintendo Switch edition continues this legacy of boundless creativity on the go and at home. By uniting global communities and profiles across all devices, players break down the walls separating platforms to build, chat and adventurer together regardless of screens used. With new updatesadding even more reasons to keep mining and crafting for years to come, the hybrid versatility of Nintendo Switch makes it an easy choice for any fan of virtual construction without constraints.
