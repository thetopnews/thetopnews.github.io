### Unlinking **FiveM Mods** Rich Presence from Your Discord Profile
To unlink FiveM's Rich Presence feature from your Discord profile, start by logging into your Discord account and navigating to the **Settings menu**. Within settings, look for the **Authorized Apps** section and click on it to view any third-party apps which have been granted access to your profile. You should see an entry here for the **FiveM Client application**. Click the **Deauthorize** button next to it to revoke access for the FiveM app to view and share your current activity. **However, sometimes re-launching the FiveM game client may automatically re-link your account.** To be sure it remains unlinked, avoid restarting FiveM until your activity status stops displaying in Discord.

### Toggle **Rich Presence Updates** Off in Your Global Discord Settings 
As an alternative to fully deauthorizing the FiveM app in Discord, you can toggle **Rich Presence sharing** off as a whole to prevent any games from broadcasting your playing status. Go back to the main Settings page in Discord and look for the **Connections** section. Within here, find the switch to **Enable/Disable** sharing of your **Rich Presence activities** with others. Flip this to the "off" position to stop the auto-detection of games running on your PC like FiveM and the broadcasting of that info to your Discord profile.
### Contacting the Discord Support Team to Recover an Inaccessible Account
If your Discord account has inexplicably been disabled or locked out due to a violation of the service's policies, do not panic. The only entity who can assist with restoring access is Discord support staff themselves. Navigate to Discord's official support website and initiate a ticket by clicking the blue "Get Support" button. When the ticket form loads, describe your issue concisely and include any relevant details such as your username, approximate date the blocking occurred, and if possible why you believe the action was taken against your account. Be truthful, patient, and cooperative as support reviews your case.
### Expect to Confirm Your Identity Through Account Recovery Methods  
After submitting the initial ticket, Discord staff may get back in touch requesting identity verification to restore ownership rights to the disabled profile. Common means used involve confirming the **email address** and **phone number** associated with the account. These details were likely used during account creation, so dig them up if needed and respond quickly to ID checks through the channels Discord provides like text or email. Completing identity authentication successfully allows the formal disabled account recovery process to proceed smoothly.  
### Gather Important Details to Expedite the Review Process
When appealing to have a locked profile reopened, come prepared with certain information to validate you as the rightful account holder. Maintain handy records of your exact Discord **username**, any **previously used display names**, all **email addresses registered** to the profile over time, and approximately when the account was **first created on Discord**. Payment histories for services linked to the profile can also help prove ownership as Discord agents investigate the case. Disclose candidly if prior violations occurred to be upfront and aid transparency during the examination. 
### Allocate Sufficient Time for Thorough Review by Staff  
Understand that Discord support teams face high volume and limited resources managing numerous recovery petitions daily across their massive userbase. Give the assigned agent breathing room to scrutinize account details, activity history, ID proofs provided, and make an informed verdict on reinstating accessibility. Regularly checking ticket statuses and submitting duplicate requests only creates more work and clutter that could slow down resolution. Aim to wait at minimum one full business week before following up respectfully if no update surfaced yet. Your patience will be noticed and appreciated.
### Stay Polite When appealing Initial Denials of Access Requests
On the chance your first disabled account recovery appeal gets rejected, do not lose hope. Like any problem-solving process, setbacks occur and multiple attempts sometimes prove necessary. Remain courteous and level-headed upon receiving a rejection notice. Reply to Discord support thanking them for consideration and humbly ask if any new information might sway their decision upon reexamination. Highlight any fresh details discovered to potentially strengthen your ownership claim. Keep language calm, considerate and solution-focused throughout all back-and-forth discussions with agents for the best possible outcome.  
### Review Account Security Settings Post-Recovery  
Once account access finally restores, do not leave profile security settings at their pre-disabled state. Consider upgrading safeguards like enabling **two-factor authentication** for login via app or email/SMS codes which adds an extra layer of protection against hijacking. Also audit linked personal and payment info like address and billing details for accuracy and security. Enable security notifications to alert of sign-in attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices. Be proactive about long-term account safety moving forward post recovery process completion.
### Learn From Experience to Avoid Repeated Disabling Actions
Having a Discord account suddenly barred due to policy breaches presents teachable moments. Brush up on the service's **Terms of Service** and **Community Guidelines** policies governing appropriate member behavior. Make modifications if any past activities toe the line too closely. Respect all servers, channels, and other users you interact with. Consult official Discord help pages regarding what actions can trigger blocking. Participate appropriately going forward so a fully functional account status stays intact long-term without risk of future disabling actions disrupting your ability to enjoy all Discord has to offer over time.
I hope this article provided helpful details on managing your Discord profile activity status, recovering access after being locked out, beefing up security post-recovery, and avoiding actions leading to repeated violations down the road. Let me know if any part of the account recovery or management process remains unclear!
