### The Limitations of Non-Cross-Platform Gaming
The current gaming landscape sees most popular online titles locked to specific hardware platforms, despite multiplayer components designed for broad communities. This restrictive approach prevents widespread engagement and needlessly limits the potential audience for multiplayer games. By restricting access based on the device, platform holders undermine the interactive nature of online multiplayer. 
Gamers want to be able to access the same digital games library and communities across whatever devices they choose to play on. However, players are currently forced to repeatedly purchase the same titles if they want to play with friends on different systems. **This redundant purchasing creates unnecessary costs for loyal customers and acts as a frustration barrier rather than introducing them to new platforms.** 
Without cross-play and cross-buy functionality, popular multiplayer games are fractured across platforms. Close-knit gaming groups find themselves separated when some upgrade hardware or switch platforms. Meanwhile, new players struggle to join established communities that spill across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC divides. **Platform-locked online games undermine the social experiences that keep players engaged for years.**

### Fortnite Paved the Path for Cross-Platform Play 
The popularity of Fortnite demonstrated there is substantial demand for cross-platform functionality in online multiplayer games. Its fully integrated cross-play allowed the vibrant Fortnite community to unite across platforms. This successful model helped prove that **cross-platform play enhances rather than detracts from the multiplayer experience and business success.** 
However, Fortnite remained an outlier for years due to resistance from platform holders. Sony in particular was reluctant to enable cross-play with competitors' hardware. This stance reinforced artificial platform silos at the expense of users. But pressure from gamers and Epic Games' example eventually softened opposition, opening the way for more developers to implement robust cross-platform support.
### Multi-Platform Accounts are the Logical Solution
To give players true access to their games library regardless of the device used, a common-sense solution is cross-compatible digital accounts. Services from EA, Xbox and others already allow playing licensed games across PC and consoles using a single account. However, limitations remain where individual games must still be repurchased for each platform.
A fully integrated model would see game licenses remain tied to user accounts rather than specific hardware. This would enable games, add-ons and progress to seamlessly roam with players between any supported devices. Rather than treating each platform as a separate market and forcing duplicate purchases, a user's digital games collection should act as a permanent redemption library. 
If developers and publishers moved license management to unified accounts, multiplayer communities could thrive regardless of hardware divisions. No longer would friends need to own duplicate versions just to play together. Access would be granted across platforms through ownership verified by central user accounts.
### Competitive Pressure Can Drive Cross-Platform Adoption
Platform holders understandably want consumers locked within proprietary ecosystems for commercial reasons. However, competition may prove a powerful driver if more adopt pro-consumer stances. Nintendo's Switch for example has enjoyed success with its flexible hybrid design appealing to fans of its IP on the go or hooked to TVs. 
By embracing cross-platform functionality and allowing its games to serve communities beyond the Switch alone, Nintendo could attract a whole new audience. Fortnite showed that games flourish on every system where they are given access. If other platforms wish to remain relevant and avoid missing out on phenomena like Fortnite, adapting business models to embrace cross-functionality will become increasingly necessary. 
Network effects also come into play - players want access to the platforms where their friends and the largest communities convene. So first-mover platforms that court multi-platform gamers stand to benefit most over time, gaining competitive advantages through enlarged networks as cross-compatibility widens user bases. Resistance to cross-play limits the potential scale of online games while enabling it expands their addressable markets.
### Cross-Buy Unlocks Additional Profit Streams
While platform holders rely on exclusive titles and services to drive hardware sales, a cross-buy model could open additional profitable avenues. Rather than lose sales from players who will purchase a game just once on their primary device, unified digital libraries introduce the potential for incrementalfurther spending. 
For example, those who owned a game on Xbox may feel justified in also purchasing DLC or special editions for a portable Switch version, or may be enticed to try new in-game monetization like cosmetic bundles. Cross-saving could further enhance engagement and spending potential by keeping live-service games fresh across sessions on various platforms. 
A well-designed online framework allowing cross-play, cross-progression and cross-purchasing has commercial potential to expand revenues streams for publishers and platforms alike. By better satisfying users with seamless access to their libraries, goodwill and further investment may follow for those who address demand for omni-platform play.
### Modern Consoles Are Powerful PCs at Heart
Behind marketing distinctions, today's game consoles run on modified PC architectures using components like x86 CPUs. With standardized technologies, the underlying hardware between a PlayStation and gaming laptop shows more common ground than divisions. This convergence enables developers to easily port between platforms. 
Likewise, online networks have homogenized. With cloud infrastructure abstracting away platform specifics, the same multiplayer codebases feasibly support cross-platform sessions. The underlying technology is available, yet commercial aspects remain the primary barriers preventing wider utilization. As platform silos inevitably decline in a post-PC era, businesses must rethink strategies to stay relevant within an emerging unified ecosystem driven by user expectations for flexibility.
### A Path Towards Truly Cross-Platform Gaming 
For the online gaming sector to achieve its full potential, developers and platform holders must adopt business models aligned with how players naturally engage. Multiplayer games thrive when communities spill into large aggregates, rather than splintering across segregated platforms. Fully unlocked libraries enabled by unified account systems and cross-compatibility are what keep players invested for the long term. 
Network effects also favor platforms that successfully build the largest interconnected networks. While commercial conflicts initially stalled progress, examples like Fortnite and pressure from engaged user bases indicate desire for such interconnected models. Competition should continue pushing evolution towards cross-compatibility standards that dissolve artificial platform divisions, liberating next-generation online titles and players to achieve new scales.
By respecting how online communities naturally interact independently of hardware silos and rethinking monetization approaches, the entire industry stands to benefit. Cross-platform gaming need not compromise commercial success - it can expand markets and better serve engaged player bases. With today's technical feasibility, the way forward is adapting business models to empower development of genuinely unified online ecosystems.
