## Getting Started with Remote Play (**mobile game streaming**)
Remote Play allows PlayStation 4 owners to stream and play their PlayStation 4 games on their iPhone or other supported mobile devices anywhere there is a stable internet connection. All you need is a PlayStation 4 console, an iPhone 6s or newer running iOS 13 or higher, the PlayStation Remote Play mobile app, and either a DualShock 4 wireless controller or touchscreen controls. 
### Downloading and Setting Up Remote Play
The first step is to download the **PlayStation Remote Play** app for free from the App Store. Make sure your PlayStation 4 and iPhone are connected to the same WiFi network. Open the app and sign in with your PSN account. The app will detect your PS4 and walk you through pairing your devices. Accept the prompts on both your iPhone and PS4.

### Connecting a DualShock 4 Controller 
For the best experience, connect your DualShock 4 wireless controller to your iPhone via Bluetooth or with a USB cable. The touchscreen works fine for basic navigation but a controller provides full control. Pair your DualShock 4 by holding the Share and PS buttons until the light flashes. Go to Bluetooth settings on your iPhone and select the controller.
## Playing Games Remotely with Low Latency
With the setup complete, you're now able to stream and play your PS4 games directly from your console on your iPhone. The experience aims to replicate playing on your TV with minimal latency (**input lag**). Performance depends on your home network connectivity. 
### Optimizing Your Network 
For the lowest latency, position your PS4 and iPhone on the strongest WiFi band in your home. Consider upgrading to a dual-band router if possible. You can also try wired connections with an ethernet cable for more stable speeds. Close any apps using bandwidth in the background for best results.
### Adjusting Button Sensitivity
Depending on the game, you may need to adjust the button sensitivity settings within Remote Play. Some games require precision and you can tune things like trigger sensitivity. Take time to optimize settings for a smooth, responsive experience tailored to your game.
## Continuing Games on the Go
One of the best uses of Remote Play is continuing your PS4 games when away from home. As long as your console remains on and connected to the internet, you can pick up where you left off.
### Keeping Saves Synced 
The Remote Play app automatically keeps your saved games synced, so no need to manually upload or download. Resume missions, levels or saves seamlessly whether at home or away. Games remain up to date thanks to your PS4 downloading updates.
### Casual Mobile Gaming 
Remote Play is perfect for more laidback gaming on mobile. Knock out side missions, collectibles or daily challenges when traveling or on breaks. Leave intensive levels or boss battles for higher powered screens at home.
## Compatibility and Considerations 
While Remote Play support continues expanding, not every game is fully compatible yet. Some multiplayer modes also don't work remotely. Here are a few other considerations.
### Internet Requirements
You'll need a continuous, stable internet connection on both your PS4 and device for Remote Play. Performance seriously degrades with intermittent connections. Wired is still preferable over wireless for reliability. 
### Controller Support 
Controller support varies per game. Games relying heavily on analog sticks, buttons or sensors may not translate as well to touch controls. A controller is highly recommended where possible.
### Screen Size Limitations
While Remote Play streams at 1080p, mobile screens have far lower resolutions than TVs. Smaller text or finer detail can be difficult to see depending on your iPhone model. Consider an iPad for larger games.
## Improving Your Remote Play Experience
With some tweaks, you can enhance your Remote Play gaming sessions. Try these optimizations for better quality and lower latency.
### Prioritize Your PS4's WiFi Band
If your router supports 5GHz WiFi, connect your PS4 to this band exclusively for streaming. It has faster speeds over shorter distances than 2.4GHz.
### Close Background Apps and Services  
When playing remotely, force close any apps running in the background on your device that could consume bandwidth like streaming services, updates, etc. 
### Adjust Touch Button Sizes 
The app lets you resize virtual buttons for touch controls. Bigger buttons mean less precision but easier inputs overall, especially helpful for racing/flying games.
### Test in Non-Gaming Areas of Your Home
Move around your house and yard while playing to test range and speeds away from your router. Helps identify ideal play spots for higher quality streams.
## Conclusion
Whether continuing games while away on trips or squeezing in quick sessions wherever you go, Remote Play delivers an impressive mobile gaming experience thanks to streaming technology. With the right setup, connections and troubleshooting, you can enjoy your PlayStation 4 games virtually anywhere.
