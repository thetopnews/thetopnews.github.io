## The High Anticipation and Troubled Launch of Cyberpunk 2077
Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated video games of 2020. Developed by renowned Polish studio CD Projekt Red, known for the acclaimed Witcher series, Cyberpunk 2077 promised to deliver an expansive, open world RPG set in a futuristic dystopian universe. However, the game's launch in December 2020 was marred by significant technical issues, especially on base PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. Bugs, glitches and poor performance destroyed the player experience for many. This led Sony to take the unprecedented step of removing Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store just days after its release, dealing a major blow to the game's sales and reputation.
### Broken Promises and Severe Backlash 
In the lead up to launch, **CD Projekt Red heavily marketed Cyberpunk 2077** and its development teams stated the game ran "surprisingly well" even on base consoles. However, these promises proved hollow. When players booted up the game, they encountered game-breaking bugs, poor frame rates, and graphical issues that made the game nearly unplayable on PS4 and Xbox One. The substantial technical shortcomings betrayed consumer trust and goodwill, generating a massive wave of criticism, frustration and refund requests. Cyberpunk 2077 became symbolic of the perils of hype, ambitious scope, and lack of adequate quality assurance.

### Sony's Unprecedented Removal from the PlayStation Store
Faced with an onslaught of refund requests and complaints, **Sony took the unprecedented step of removing Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store**. This removed the game entirely from new digital purchases on PlayStation consoles, a dramatic escalation beyond standard refund policies. It marked the first time a major third-party game had been pulled from PlayStation digital storefront. The move highlighted how severely CD Projekt Red had failed to meet Sony's certification standards for user experience and technical stability.
## Rigorous Certification Process Intended to Ensure High Quality Experiences  
Platform owners like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo maintain rigorous certification processes for third-party games released on their systems. This is intended to validate performance, functionality, and maintain a consistent level of quality across all titles. However, as Cyberpunk 2077 demonstrated, even major developers can fall short.
### Technical Testing and Performance Standards
Before a game is allowed for commercial release on consoles like PlayStation and Xbox, **developers must submit their games for technical testing and certification**. This process involves platforms running the game on actual hardware to evaluate performance, check for crashes/bugs, and ensure an acceptable level of stability and polish. Games must meet standards for consistent frame rates, proper functionality of all features, and be free of game-breaking issues. 
### Provisional Approval with Patches Planned 
If minor bugs are encountered that can be addressed with a planned post-launch patch, platforms may grant **provisional certification**. However, the level of issues in Cyberpunk 2077, especially on PS4/Xbox One, far exceeded expectations even with patches promised. This showed how certification is not a guarantee, and highlighted the consequences of neglecting quality assurance.
## How Cyberpunk 2077 Failed Certification Standards
Despite its technical shortcomings evident at launch, how was Cyberpunk 2077 granted any form of certification approval from Sony and other platforms in the first place? The answers shed light on certification's limitations and the cracks that can emerge even in a rigorous process.
### Overpromising and Under-Testing on Older Hardware
It appears **CD Projekt Red overpromised the game's performance** on base PS4 and Xbox One consoles in its marketing. This likely downplayed issues encountered during certification testing. Additionally, there are hints the developer focused most testing on high-end PCs and next-gen consoles, **neglecting to fully stress test on older hardware** that still represented a major install base.
### Pressure to Launch Led to Provisional Approval 
Eager to hit the game's release date after multiple delays, **CD Projekt Red was likely granted provisional certification** by Sony and others on the promise of addressing bugs post-launch. But the patching process clearly failed to remedy the massive technical problems plaguing last-gen consoles. This shows how deadlines can undermine quality if used to circumvent rigorous standards.
### Substantial Bugs Slipped Through Testing Cracks
It remains unclear precisely how much platforms saw during certification, but the **sheer magnitude of bugs at Cyberpunk 2077's launch indicates significant issues slipped under the radar**. Whether through oversights, insufficient focus on legacy hardware, or other factors, something clearly went wrong in CD Projekt Red's internal testing processes to have allowed such broken code into players' hands on day one.
## Lessons Learned About the Importance of Rigorous Testing
The Cyberpunk 2077 debacle serves as an instructive cautionary tale emphasizing the need for stringent development practices, thorough quality assurance processes, and fulfillment of platform certification standards. Major takeaways include:
- Developers must adequately test all supported platforms, especially older hardware still in widespread use.
- Promises made during certification or marketing should be backed by demonstrable performance during testing processes. 
- Provisional approvals are not guarantees, and day-one patches are not substitutes for thoroughly addressing any detected issues before launch. 
- Maintaining certification standards protects consumers and fosters continued trust between platforms and partners.
- Creative scope and deadlines must be balanced with sufficient time for refinement, polish and eliminating bugs to deliver a quality experience.
Overall, Cyberpunk 2077's troubled launch demonstrated that even industry veterans are not exempt if sufficient precautions are not taken to fully **stress test, fix problems and meet the rigorous standards of certification authorities.** The expectations and trust of eager fans can be easily squandered without due diligence.
