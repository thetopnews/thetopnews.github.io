### PSVR-Original Experiences
Some of the most acclaimed PSVR games were built from the ground up for virtual reality. Titles like **Beat Saber**, **Astro Bot Rescue Mission**, and **Blood & Truth** are solely playable in VR. They utilize motion controllers and room-scale tracking for fully immersive 3D worlds. Beat Saber in particular has become one of the most popular VR rhythm games, tasking players with slicing blocks to the beat. Astro Bot and Blood & Truth showcase rich single-player adventure gameplay. Overall, PSVR exclusives demonstrate the exciting possibilities of dedicated VR development.
### Playing Non-VR Games in "Cinema Mode"
While not a true virtual reality experience, PSVR's "Cinema Mode" does allow playing standard PS4 games on a massive virtual screen. This can be a novel way to experience non-VR titles in a new format. However, it is more of a passive viewing option since standard controllers lack positional tracking. Despite the lack of true interactivity, some find it an entertaining way to play games on a massive virtual display.
### Fully Immersive Conversions
Some non-VR titles have received full VR overhauls through additional development. Games like **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR** and **Resident Evil 7** completely reworked their designs for room-scale positioning. With motion controls, players can physically move, aim weapons, interact with objects, and look around virtual worlds. Skyrim VR in particular set an early standard for compelling converted experiences. By remastering mechanics for VR, these ports deliver some of the most engaging gameplay on PSVR.
### Continued Library Growth

Over 200 VR games are now available spanning genres like horror, adventure, racing, and more. With continued support from Sony and third parties, fresh PSVR content ensures the platform remains a vibrant destination for both veterans and newcomers alike. Exciting future releases will surely help expand the audience even further.
