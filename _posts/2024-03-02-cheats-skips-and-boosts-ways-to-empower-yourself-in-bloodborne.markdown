## No Real Cheats but Hidden Paths 
Bloodborne does not include any traditional cheat codes, but dedicated players have discovered several technical area skips and shortcuts throughout Yharnam and its nightmares. While **Bloodborne sequence breaking** and **area skips** allow experienced Hunters to bypass large sections of the game with precise platforming or aggro tricks, they are not necessarily the intended way to experience the masterful level design of FromSoftware. For casual players looking to immerse themselves in the gothic horror world for the first time, it is usually better to just play through the game as intended without skips.
### Yahar'gul Skip 
One well known skip is bypassing most of the cursed **Yahar'gul unseen village** by dropping down from a ledge after fighting Vicar Amelia. With careful navigation of some narrow beams, a Hunter can reach the unseen village lamps without battling through the confusing streets and dealing with the insane villagers. However, this also means missing out on discovering the sinister secrets of this nightmarish zone.

### Sewer Skip
Another notable skip is bypassing the entirety of the expansive sewer and swamp area by dropping down from a platform above. While this **Sewer shortcut** shaves off a significant chunk of the level, it deprives players from acquiring rare weapons, armor and valuable blood gemstone drops found throughout the sewers.
## False Depth Chalices - A Method of Progression Boosting
Beyond the main game, the procedurally generated **Chalice Dungeons** offer replayability with new layouts and enemies each run. Resourceful players have also created falsified Chalice Dungeons by modifying their structure and contents. Known as "false depth" Chalices, some provide immense benefits like boosted echoes or powerful gems not acquirable otherwise. 
### Easy Leveling with False Roots
One popular edited Chalice, called "FRC false roots," contains enhanced encounters that grant around 90,000 echoes per run which can be reset repeatedly. This allows Hunters to quickly gain experience and reach the high **Blood Level 90** cap in a fraction of the time compared to traditional leveling. However, some see this method as "cheating" due to the artificially inflated gains not intended by FromSoftware.
### Superior Gems from Edited Dungeons 
Edited Chalices also offer gemstone drops far exceeding the power of normal gems available in the base game and official Chalice Dungeons. Gems with boosts like +65 physical attack or +140 physical defense make weapons and armor significantly more potent than anything attainable without false depth cheats. While this allows for overwhelming power, it removes much of the balanced challenge FromSoftware aimed to provide.
## Later Chalices for Massive Echo Farming  
The cursed **Pthumerian root Chalices** hold danger and reward in spades for experienced players. Later rituals containing elite foes yield enormous 800,000+ echoes per run. Due to this enticing payout, Hunters die in droves as one hit often means instant death against these merciless enemies. However, the incredible echoes allow achieving maximum **Blood Level 544** within reasonable time for dedicated PvP characters. Only those looking to push their abilities and stats to astronomical levels for specialized PvP or challenge runs find value in these high-risk echo farms.
### Cursed Root Depths 
The deepest recesses of the cursed Pthumerian labyrinth hold terrors that can annihilate any careless Hunter. In the misty chamber of the Defiled Pthumeru Chalice, amid abominations and deformed beasts, souls bold enough to brave this hellscape face diminutive health reduced to a mere 5% of their maximum. Even the slightest graze spells doom, as survival requires perfection. Yet within, echoes number over 1 million per run providing a massive boost for one who endures this gauntlet below the waking world.  
## Views on Using Boosts in a Fromsoftware Game
Use of boosted progression methods in Soulsborne games sparks debate between those who consider them cheating and those who feel players should experience the game however they choose. On one hand, some argue **chalice dungeon editing** or sequence breaking removes the intended difficulty curve and sense of accomplishment FromSoftware aimed to deliver through overcoming fair challenges. However, others counter that since the games are primarily single player experiences without online leaderboards, there is no competitive advantage gained. As long as cheats are not used in cooperative or adversarial multiplayer, boosts only impact one's own game.  
### Preserving the Vision vs. Personal Freedom
Preserving the original vision of the developers is important to ensuring games provide the experience creatives intended. At the same time, allowing personal freedom for players to customize difficulties respects that games are meant to be enjoyable rather than stressful. For dedicated fans attracted by FromSoftware's brilliance, appreciating the art as intended provides greatest reward. But for casual or time-strapped players, boosts removing repetitive grinding offer a valid way to experience the gripping worlds and boss battles. In the end, Soulsborne aficionados will continue debating which methods of empowerment enhance or diminish this beloved franchise.
## Comparing Bloodborne and Sekiro  
FromSoftware cementing their status as master craftsmen with each new release, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice represent two peaks of the action RPG genre. Both transport players to staggeringly atmospheric worlds steeped in Eastern influences, presenting nuanced combat systems demanding skill and intuition to overcome immense adversaries. While retaining the Soulslike foundation of perilous exploration and punishing yet fair battles, each title innovates in its own distinct direction.
### Aggressive Hunting vs. Stealth and Parrying 
Bloodborne emphasizes fast-paced, aggressive melee combat with weapons like saw cleavers and trick weapons favoring sustained assaults over defensive play. In contrast, Sekiro focuses on precise parrying, stealth tactics, and vertical mobility and exploration using grappling hooks. Where Bloodborne rewarded two-handed strength, Sekiro demands mastering precise parries and breakable postures through sword combat with shinobi prosthetics. Both achieve superb feel and responsive mechanics realizing their divergent combat visions.
### Gothic Horror vs. Feudal Japan 
From a narrative perspective, Bloodborne immerses players in Lovecraftian cosmic horror amid the crumbling gothic spires and eldritch sea towns of Yharnam. Sekiro instead transports to 16th century Feudal Japan during its turbulent Warring States period, presenting a breathtaking open world amid lush forests and sweeping vistas. Both infuse settings with immense atmosphere and lore to uncover through item descriptions and environmental storytelling. While different in theme, each establishes a richly detailed world players become engrossed within.
## Choosing Between the Games
For those with the means to experience only one of FromSoftware's modern masterworks, choosing between Bloodborne and Sekiro requires weighing several factors. As a PlayStation exclusive, Bloodborne can only be played on Sony consoles preventing many from access. However, it remains a technical and artistic tour de force otherwise unavailable anywhere else. Sekiro on the other hand is multi-platform, allowing Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PC gamers to embark on its adventure as well. 
Beyond platforms, preferences in combat style will influence many - Bloodborne favors aggressive melee while Sekiro requires precise reflexes and parrying. Storytelling approach also differs, with Bloodborne presenting murkier Lovecraftian mysteries against Sekiro's more overtly conveyed Feudal Japanese plot. Ultimately, both rank among the finest action games of their generation, so any Soulsborne fan would find immeasurable delight in either gothic Yharnam or feudal Ashina's memorable lands. For those with option, both are worthy experiences to seek out.
