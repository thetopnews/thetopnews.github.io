### Majority of Xbox 360 Games Run Well But Performance Can Vary
Most games run very well through the emulator with only slight differences compared to the Xbox 360 original.

### Checking Game Compatibility and Purchase Options

Both physical and digital copies can then be accessed in the user's Xbox library like any other owned game.

### Comparing Backwards Compatibility Across Console Generations
The ability to play games across hardware generations has been an important focus for Microsoft with each new Xbox console release.
