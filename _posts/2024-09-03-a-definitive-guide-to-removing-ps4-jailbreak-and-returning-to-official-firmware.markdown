### Back Up Your Data and Prepare for the Journey
Before beginning the removal process, it is crucial to back up any important game saves or files to an external USB drive. A full initialization of the console will wipe all locally stored data, so preserving your progress is a must. Once backed up, power down the console fully and disconnect it from the power outlet for a few minutes. This will ensure it is in the optimal state to begin the journey back to legitimate use.

### Initialization: A Fresh Slate is Key 
Power the console back on and go to the **Settings menu**. Select **Initialization** and follow the on-screen prompts to perform a full reset, erasing all data and returning the console to its factory condition. This step is vital, as it wipes any traces of the jailbreak software and puts the operating system in a blank slate. Monitor the process until complete before moving forward.
### Updating is Crucial for Removal
After initialization finishes, the console will boot up and begin the initial setup flow once more. At this point, it will automatically check for and download any available system software **updates**. Let this process fully complete without interrupting - the **updates** are what will close any vulnerabilities previously exploited by the jailbreak. Once installation finishes, the console should prompt for network setup and PSN sign in.
### Create a Fresh PSN Account
Even after following the prior steps, some lingering risks may remain if signing back into the original PSN account that was used during the jailbroken period. To fully remove any chances of restrictions or bans, it is strongly advised to create an entirely **new PSN account** and associate the console with it going forward. Use this clean account for all online activities.
### Verify Firmware and Functionality 
With the fresh setup complete, check that the console is now running the latest public non-jailbroken version of the firmware, such as **9.05**. Test basic online features like accessing the PlayStation Store or multiplayer modes - if all functions as normal, the jailbreak has likely been properly removed. Keep an eye out for any error messages during initial online use as well.
### Recovering Saved Data
Once the legitimate firmware and standard console operation have been confirmed, feel free to log back into the original PSN account if desired. Next, restore any game save files or other data that were backed up to external storage before initialization. This returns progression without risking reinfection of the jailbreak. Take care not to copy over any foreign executable files though.
### Resist Temptation Going Forward
Now that the console is back to its clean, standard state, it is important to avoid becoming tempted to jailbreak it once more. Staying on the always-updating public firmware helps ward off possible jailbreaking vulnerabilities down the road. Stick to legitimate software sources and always fully update when prompted going forward.
### Help Others on Their Journey
For those who decide to remove jailbreaks from their consoles, sharing the experience can aid others looking to do the same. Offer to discuss and advise on removal techniques, common issues seen, and reassure them a clean console can be achieved. With a community effort, the number of unauthorized jailbroken systems prowling PSN can be reduced.
### Enjoy Legitimacy and Keep Gaming
With the process complete, gaming and media enjoyment should now be restriction-free online or off. Appreciate access to the always-evolving PlayStation experience without the looming threat of punitive actions. Continued legitimate use and periodic system updates also ensure compatibility moving forward with new releases. The journey was worthwhile to restore full functionality securely long-term.
In summary, by thoroughly following the outlined steps, it is very possible to safely remove jailbreaks from **PS4 consoles** and return them to normal, compliant use on official Sony firmware. Patience during initialization, software updates and verification is key to achieving a thorough clean slate. With preparation and community support, restitution of legitimate gaming is achievable.
