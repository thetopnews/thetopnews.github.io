## Part 1: The Types of PS5 Upgrades Available Today 
### **Free Versus Paid Graphics and Features Updates**
Some PlayStation 4 games that are playable on PS5 through backwards compatibility receive free updates that take advantage of the new console's more powerful hardware without any additional purchase required. These "free upgrades" typically focus on improving visuals like texture quality, rendering resolution, framerates and loading times. However, other games offer "paid upgrades" where gamers must purchase an enhanced PS5 version to access the full set of graphical upgrades, new gameplay features and other enhancements programmed specifically for the new platform. Whether a particular title receives a free or paid upgrade depends entirely on the individual game developer's plans and policies.

## Part 2: Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 - Running on Backwards Compatibility for Now 
### **Only Seeing Faster Load Times So Far** 
Two massively popular open world franchises, Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, are currently playable on PS5 backward compatibility from their PS4 versions. This allows those who already own the games to continue their adventures on the new hardware. However, without true native next-gen upgrades, the main benefit is decreased loading times thanks to the PS5's ultra-fast solid state drive rather than major visual or technical improvements. 
### **An Enhanced GTA V Edition Coming in 2022**
Rockstar Games has announced "enhanced and expanded" versions of GTA V optimized for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC launching in the second quarter of 2022. This will include a range of technical enhancements and visual upgrades to take advantage of the latest console capabilities. But for Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar has not disclosed any plans for a similar next-gen iteration at this time.
## Part 3: Hoping for Paid PlayStation 5 Upgrades Like Other Titles
### **Successful Paid PS5 Upgrade Examples in Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima**  
Some titles such as Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from Kojima Productions and Sucker Punch respectively did receive premium paid PlayStation 5 upgrades. These new versions added significant graphical improvements like true 4K resolutions and 60fps frame rates alongside new gameplay features, modes and other benefits. For many gamers, this approach represents the ideal solution - enjoying a significantly enhanced experience through an affordable one-time purchase rather than buying the games again at full price.
### **Hoping Future GTA V and RDR2 PS5 Versions Follow a Similar Paid Upgrade Model**
With Rockstar's commitment to next-gen editions of GTA V, hopes are high they will deliver a matching caliber of upgrades for a reasonable additional purchase rather than requiring customers to re-buy the entire games. And if Red Dead Redemption 2 does get a PS5 update down the road, the paid upgrade path seems like the likeliest and most consumer-friendly business model to follow.
## Part 4: Continuing to Enjoy Past Consoles and the Perks of Backwards Compatibility  
### **Maintaining a Multi-Generational Console Collection**
As a lifelong gamer, the author has held onto PlayStation hardware from various eras going all the way back to the original PlayStation of the 1990s. This allows reliving gaming memories of the past through revisiting classic titles. It also enables continuing to play PlayStation 4 games on the new PlayStation 5 thanks to its backwards compatibility functions. Maintaining a collection spanning generations provides valuable entertainment and nostalgia for both new and retro experiences.
### **Backwards Compatibility Keeps Older Systems Relevant**  
Being able to access past libraries of games on newer machines keeps value in previous consoles long after new ones emerge. Rather than gaming history becoming obsolete, backwards compatible systems honor the past while embracing the future. This gives players more choice and flexibility in their experiences.
## Part 5: Excitement and Anticipation Growing for Enhanced GTA V and RDR2 PlayStation 5 Versions
### **Eager to See Rockstar's Open World Marvels in Next-Gen Glory**
As massive, immersive game worlds, Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 are perfect candidates to truly shine when optimized for PlayStation 5 hardware. Fans can hardly wait to experience the intricately detailed city of Los Santos and sweeping American frontier of Red Dead's territories with cutting-edge visuals and smooth frame rates enabled by next-gen optimizations. 
### **Hopes for Additional Story Content and Gameplay Improvements** 
Beyond just upgrades to graphics, many also hope Rockstar will take advantage of new technology to enhance the core games too through expanded single-player missions, multiplayer modes or revised mechanics. The potential seems vast for reinvigorating already epic adventures.
## Part 6: Conclusions - Looking Forward to PlayStation 5's Future
