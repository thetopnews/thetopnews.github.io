### Getting into the Action with Warzone
**Warzone** allows up to **150 players** to compete in either **trios, quads, or solos** on the massive Verdansk map. As a **standalone free-to-play title**, **Warzone** can be accessed and enjoyed without purchasing the full **Modern Warfare** game or paying any additional subscription fees. **PlayStation Plus**, **Xbox Live Gold**, and other paid memberships are **not required** to drop into **Verdansk** and battle other players. Anyone with a copy of the core **Modern Warfare** game on **PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC** can freely access and play **Warzone** whenever they want.
### Subscriptions Needed for Standard Multiplayer
While **Warzone** provides free-to-play large scale battle royale action, the standard multiplayer modes included with **Modern Warfare** do require paid memberships on consoles. On both **PlayStation 4 and Xbox One**, an active **PlayStation Plus subscription or Xbox Live Gold membership** is necessary to play **Modern Warfare**'s traditional 6v6, 10v10, and Ground War matchmaking. However, the **multiplayer component does not demand subscriptions on PC**, allowing PC gamers to enjoy all online modes at no extra cost beyond the core game purchase. 
### Platform-Dependent Requirements 
The online requirements for **Modern Warfare** vary depending on the platform. On **PlayStation 4 specifically**, a **PlayStation Plus membership is only needed for accessing the main multiplayer modes**. The massive **Warzone battle royale mode and campaign can still be played online without a subscription**. Meanwhile, **Xbox Live Gold is mandatory for any online functionality in Modern Warfare on Xbox**, whether playing **Warzone, standard multiplayer, or campaign in co-op**. 
### No Fees Required on PC
PC offers the most barrier-free experience for enjoying **Modern Warfare** online. **Modern Warfare on Battle.net does not mandate any paid subscriptions like PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold** to access multiplayer, **Warzone**, or online co-op. As long as a player owns the game digitally through **Battle.net on their Windows PC**, the entire package is unlockable and playable without extra subscription or member fees. This makes PC an appealing option for those seeking the complete **Modern Warfare** experience at no recurring cost beyond the initial game purchase.
### Common Confusion Around Requirements
There seems to be persistent confusion around the subscription needs for playing different elements of **Modern Warfare** across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. While **Warzone can be accessed freely by all**, the core **multiplayer modes do require certain paid memberships on consoles**. It's understandable why players may be unclear on these nuanced distinctions for each specific platform. To avoid potential disappointment, it's important for fans new and old to fully understand the online requirements for their system before diving into **Modern Warfare**'s various modes.
### Wrapping It All Up
In summary, for the latest information on playing **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** online: 
- **Warzone** battle royale is completely **free-to-play** on all platforms with no subscriptions needed
- **PlayStation 4 requires PlayStation Plus only for standard multiplayer**, not **Warzone** or campaign
