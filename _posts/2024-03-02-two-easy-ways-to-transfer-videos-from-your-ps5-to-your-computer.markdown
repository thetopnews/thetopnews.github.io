### Using an ExFAT USB Drive   
The PlayStation 5 only supports video transfers to exFAT formatted USB drives. **To transfer PS5 gameplay recordings and videos** to your computer, right click on a USB drive and select the format option. Choose exFAT as the file system to format the drive. Once formatted, connect the USB drive to one of the PlayStation 5's front-facing USB ports. Navigate to the console's Media Gallery and select the video files you want to transfer. Copy the selected files over to the USB drive. When complete, safely eject the drive from your PS5. Plug the USB drive into your Windows or Mac computer to access the transferred video files. You'll now be able to manage, edit, or backup the PlayStation 5 captures on your computer's storage.

### Making Social Media Uploads  
Another easy method to get your PS5 videos onto your computer is by uploading them to popular social media platforms first. Go to the video you wish to share in the PS5's Capture Gallery and select the share button. Pick the social media account you want to upload to, such as your YouTube or Twitch channel. The PlayStation 5 will automatically upload your selected file to the chosen site. From there, you can download the video on your computer by locating it on your social profiles and copying it to your device. This allows you to access captured PS5 gameplay from any computer after a quick social media sharing step. 
### Considering USB Drive Storage Capacity
While external USB drives provide a straightforward way to haul PS5 video files between consoles and PCs, their storage capacities do top out. The amount of space available on a USB flash drive ranges anywhere **from 8 gigabytes (GB) up to 1 terabyte (TB) depending on the model**. Users transferring a large library of high-definition PS5 recordings should carefully consider the storage needs of their drives. Large file sizes that come with high-quality 4K and HDR gameplay clips can easily overflow smaller USB capacities. Choosing a high-capacity USB 3.0 or 3.1 drive is advisable for those who consistently transfer many video captures between devices.
### Maximizing Storage Space with Compression
As an alternative to transferring raw large video files, PS5 users have the option to compress capture files directly on the console first. This helps minimize the sizes of transfers to external drives or social media platforms. In the PS5's share menu, look for the compression toggle and select it for the chosen videos. Compressing gameplay clips can significantly reduce their file sizes, sometimes cutting it by half or more depending on the compression settings and video content. While this does introduce some quality loss, it proves ideal for short casual clips where top-notch resolution isn't as important. Saving precious storage space is the main priority in these cases.
### Streaming Videos From Your PlayStation 5
Instead of moving files between devices, PS5 owners can opt to stream their captured gameplay footage remotely using the PlayStation app. No transfer times and storage space concerns with this method. Log into the PlayStation app on your smartphone, tablet, or other connected device. Browse through the Media Gallery like normal on the console then choose the "View on Device" option for any videos. The PlayStation 5 will start streaming the selected clip to your mobile or television screen over your home network. This lets you instantly share PlayStation recordings with others without relying on USB transfers or social uploads each time. Streaming provides a convenient solution when only quick access to videos is required without permanently saving locally.
### Summary
In summary, using an exFAT formatted USB flash drive or uploading captures to YouTube and other social sites are the most straightforward methods for exporting PS5 gameplay videos and screen recordings to a computer. Factors like available file sizes, compression options, and intended use of the files should guide users towards the best transfer process. For editing projects or long-term local storage, directly moving uncompressed files via USB drive remains a reliable choice. But streaming, social uploads, and on-the-fly compression are excellent alternatives when speed or temporary access is the priority over preserving maximum quality long-term. With a variety of simple options available, PlayStation 5 owners can easily export and share their gaming memories externally.
