### Stream Your Favorite Games on Windows With the Xbox App
The Xbox app for Windows 10 allows you to stream your **Xbox One games library** right to your PC. As long as your Xbox console is powered on and connected to the same network as your PC, the Xbox app will find it and allow you to select any games installed on the console. You can then use an **Xbox One wireless controller** paired to your PC to play the streamed games. 
Streaming quality options range from standard definition up to **1080p resolution at 60 frames per second**. However, the exact supported resolutions may vary depending on your console, PC hardware, and network connection speed. You'll also experience a small amount of input lag, but many games remain perfectly playable when streamed. Streaming lets you access your Xbox library even when someone else is using the TV.

### Access Over 100 Games With Xbox Game Pass for PC
Microsoft's **Game Pass subscription service** gives you access to well over 100 PC games for a low monthly fee, similar to Netflix for games. While currently only around 15 titles are fully supported for native gameplay on PC through the Xbox app and Windows Store, Microsoft steadily rolls out new additions. Game Pass for PC includes many popular titles like racing game **Forza Horizon 4** that you can try risk-free with a $1 for the first month promotion. 
### Run Original Xbox Games on Your Computer With Emulators 
If you own the original discs for Xbox games, you have the option to play them on your Windows PC using emulator software like **Cxbx or Xeon**. These emulation programs work to replicate the Xbox's system architecture on your computer's more powerful modern hardware. However, emulating console games is demanding and requires a beefy gaming rig to avoid significant performance issues or bugs.
It's only legal to run games you own physical discs for; trying to play pirated games can get you in trouble. **Online functionality is also generally not possible through emulators** due to discrepancies between console and PC networking. Still, emulators open up your old Xbox library for nostalgic single-player fun on PC.
### Current and Upcoming Xbox Exclusives Also Released for Windows
As part of its goal to make games available on any device, Microsoft commits to simultaneously launching its **first-party Xbox console exclusives** on Windows 10 PCs as well. Upcoming cross-platform titles include the sci-fi RPG **The Outer Worlds**. More future Xbox games may eventually come to PC platforms through Game Pass as the service expands its library. At the least, you can expect major Xbox studio releases to coincide on both platforms.
### Dealing with Technical Limitations Between Console and PC Platforms 
While streaming and emulation methods let you play Xbox games on a PC, both come with compromises. Games developed primarily for consoles will not run natively on Windows without advanced virtualization. **Input lag and decreased performance** are issues that arise from emulating or streaming games rather than running them locally. 
Even the most powerful PCs may struggle to perfectly replicate the Xbox hardware environment within an emulator. Technical differences between console and PC architectures mean emulators may never be 100% accurate to the authentic Xbox experience. Streaming quality relies heavily on your network connection speed and stability. With these caveats in mind, Xbox games remain largely accessible and enjoyable on Windows through the provided workarounds.
### The Future of Xbox and Windows Platform Integration
Microsoft aims to further unite Xbox and Windows gaming by making titles playable across any devices that support their platforms. Xbox Game Pass stands to gain from potential **mobile and tablet streaming apps**, in addition to an expanding PC game library. Future Xbox console hardware may take PC backwards compatibility and streaming features to an even higher level. As platforms converge, players can expect a more seamless experience traversing Xbox and Windows ecosystems. Over time, the lines between “Xbox games” and “PC games” may blur altogether into a unified model of interactive entertainment.
