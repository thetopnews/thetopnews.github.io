**Xbox home sharing and Xbox Live Gold family sharing allows multiple users to enjoy your digital library and paid memberships without purchasing additional subscriptions.** By designating an Xbox One console as your "home Xbox", anyone signed into that system can instantly access your downloaded games, apps, and benefits of Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass Ultimate memberships. 
At the same time, your personal profile retains access to digital content when playing on non-home consoles by signing in directly. With some configuration, up to ten family member accounts can also gain access to Xbox Live features across different systems through family sharing options. Let’s explore how home sharing and family plans work on Xbox One and Xbox 360 to maximize sharing your subscriptions.
### How to Designate an Xbox One as Your Home Console
Designating an Xbox One as your "home Xbox" is straightforward through your online account profile on the Xbox website. Sign in and navigate to “System” then “My home Xbox” to see your current setting. **To change the home console designation**, simply select the Xbox One system you want as your primary device. 
Only one Xbox can be associated with your profile as the home at a given time. **When transferring the home designation, it will sign out your profile from the previous primary system.** Allow some time for content rights to sync between consoles as the change propagates before others attempt to access your shared library on the new home Xbox One.

### Sharing Digital Games, Apps and Subscriptions 
Once an Xbox One is designated as your home console, **any other profile signed into that system will have instant access to your full downloaded games library**, as well as memberships for services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate without needing your profile logged in. This allows for true simultaneous multiplayer between household members without limitations.
Your personal profile retains access to your digital purchases and subscriptions when signed into other non-home Xbox Ones as well. So whether playing primarily on your home console or elsewhere, your content remains accessible. Only profiles on the home Xbox gain this shared access privilege without direct sign-in, **making it ideal for communal family devices.**
### Extending Access Through Xbox Live Family Groups
While designating an Xbox One as your home console handles game and app sharing, **Xbox Live Gold family memberships expand the reach of paid subscription benefits** like online multiplayer across a group of up to ten family member profiles. Caregivers can oversee child accounts and set limits through family settings for a secure shared experience. 
All family member accounts receive the perks of **Gold and Game Pass Ultimate**, regardless of owning the memberships themselves. And with cloud saving of profiles and games, family members can easily pick up where they left off between consoles in the home or on the go using Xbox apps on mobile and PC devices.
### Key Differences from the Xbox 360 Model 
Earlier generations of Xbox systems like the original Xbox 360 operated without the sophisticated home sharing and family plans of modern Xbox Ones. Back then, **each individual user required their own Xbox Live Gold subscription to access online multiplayer and account features**, without options to pool resources between profiles.
Game sharing between systems was also impossible on the Xbox 360 generation. **Your downloaded titles and save data remained locked exclusively to your profile.** So families with multiple Xbox 360s tended to need duplicate digital purchases or physical discs to enjoy co-op gaming between devices and people simultaneously.
### Maximizing Home Sharing Benefits
By designating the primary communal Xbox One as your home console, you allow easy plug-and-play access to your library without sign-ins for others in your household. Meanwhile, your own profile retains full ownership benefits playing remotely. And with expanded family plans, up to ten relatives and friends can partake in shared subscriptions across an even broader set of devices together.
**Home sharing on Xbox One succeeds where past generations fell short,** enabling efficient multi-user access to digital game collections and subscription perks in a way that feels more natural for groups and families. With some initial setup, these features go a long way towards justifying investments in apps, games and services by spreading the value amongst loved ones seamlessly.
### Conclusion
Whether giving friends a way to host multiplayer parties leveraging your home console's shared library remotely, or keeping multiple household members engaged with pooled access to memberships, the home sharing and family sharing options on modern Xbox platforms deliver convenience through inclusion that older systems could not match. With digital distribution now the norm, these collaborative features help strengthen the platform experience for players of all types.
