## Sending an Xbox Gift Card 
When gifting an Xbox gift card, the sender has the option to personalize the gift card with a greeting or message. This adds a nice personalized touch for the recipient.
### Selecting a Gift Amount
To send a gift card, the first step is choosing the dollar amount you'd like to gift, starting at $5 and going up to $100 in $5 increments. Most people gift between $15-$25 for stocking stuffers or $25-$50 for larger presents.

Next, the sender needs to input the recipient's email address that is associated with their Microsoft account. A brief personalized message of up to 250 characters can also be added. It's recommended to proofread the message for any errors before sending.
### Sending the Digital Code
Once all the delivery information has been entered, the sender clicks "Send Gift Card" and the code will be delivered instantly to the recipient's email. Digital codes don't expire so there is no rush for the recipient to redeem it right away. They will receive an email notifying them of the gift that was sent their way.
## Receiving an Xbox Gift Card
When an Xbox gift card is received, the process of redeeming the funds is quite seamless. 
### Gift Card Notification Email 
The recipient will get an email from Microsoft with the subject "You've received an Xbox gift!" This email contains the sender's personalized message as well as a unique redemption code. It's important to keep this code handy and not delete the email.
### Linking to Your Microsoft Account
To add the funds, the recipient needs to go to account.microsoft.com and sign in with their Microsoft credentials. Then they can enter the redemption code which will be verified and the dollar amount added to their Xbox wallet balance. 
### Viewing Your New Balance

## Redeeming Xbox Gift Card Funds 
Now that the funds are in your Xbox wallet, it's time to start spending! Here are some of the top ways gamers redeem their Xbox gift card balance.
### Downloading Games from Xbox Store
The Xbox Store has a massive catalog of games to choose from across various genres, publishers and price points. Browsing new releases, deals, and genre collections makes it easy to find the next game to **download digitally with gift card funds**. Popular franchises like Halo, Forza, Gears of War and more can be purchased this way.

Xbox gift cards are convenient for buying these enhancements directly from the Xbox Store so gamers can continue experiencing new content in their favorite titles. 
### Subscribing to Xbox Game Pass
With access to over 100 high-quality games for one low monthly price, **Xbox Game Pass** is one of the best values in gaming today. Gift card funds can be used to pay for the standard Game Pass subscription or upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate which includes Game Pass, Xbox Live Gold and exclusive member deals and perks. Both plans let gamers download and play full titles from a curated library that is always expanding on console and PC.
## Finding Discounted Xbox Gift Cards 
While retail prices for plastic cards are usually the listed value, opportunities exist to save a few dollars on digital Xbox gift cards. Here are some tips:
### Check Major Retailers for Sales 
Keep an eye out for gift card promotions throughout the year at major online stores. Gift cards are occasionally discounted during seasonal sales events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Back to School. Staying on top of deals alerts savings. 
### Compare Third-Party Digital Code Sellers
Sites like Amazon and Newegg aren't always the cheapest place to buy digital Xbox gift cards. Other stores like GameFlip, PlayerAuctions and GameCodesSell specialize in digital codes and may offer better rates if buying multiple codes at once. It's worth comparing prices across sellers. 
### Stack Cashback With Code Purchases
Use cashback browser extensions and services like Rakuten while shopping online. Their catalogs have most major digital code retailers and earn up to 5% cashback on eligible purchases. Effectively receiving a discount, this is one way to lower the cost of multipack Xbox gift card purchases.
