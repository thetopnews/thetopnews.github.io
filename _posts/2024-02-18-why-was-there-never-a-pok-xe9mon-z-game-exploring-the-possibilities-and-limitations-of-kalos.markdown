### **The Mixed Reception of Pokémon X & Y**
Pokémon X & Y were initially very well received by fans and critics when released in 2013 for introducing the franchise to 3D graphics. However, over time, some complaints arose that the games lacked depth and felt rushed. Many argued **Kalos region exploration** felt shallow with a lack of extra activities outside the main story. Some areas, like **cyberdimension mystery dungeon**, felt underdeveloped or wasted potential. While fun, the overall consensus was X & Y did not fully utilize the possibilities of the new 3D style.

### **Nintendo's Plans to Commemorate the Franchise's 20th Anniversary**  
With the franchise turning 20 in 2016, Nintendo wanted to do something major to celebrate the occasion. At the same time, revisiting an old region seemed the perfect way to bring back nostalgic fans.  Hoenn from Ruby and Sapphire was selected due to the region's strong fan favorite status. Remakes in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire allowed **classic Hoenn adventures** to continue with modern graphics and gameplay like Mega Evolution. This served as both an anniversary project and way to revisit a beloved generation without clinging too long to Kalos.
### **Moving the Franchise Forward with New Innovations**
In addition to anniversary plans, Nintendo sought ways to keep Pokémon fresh and entice new fans. Mega Evolution introduced in X & Y was becoming standard. The company wanted another major mechanic to define the next generation. Sun and Moon delivered with regional forms, Z-Moves, and the exploration of the **dystopian Alola islands**. This new direction fulfilled the goal of progressing Pokémon beyond just adding a "Z" to X & Y.
### **The Conclusion of Kalos' Plotline**  
Team Flare's villainous schemes to create a beautiful new world had been thwarted in X & Y. With their nefarious plans defeated, it remained unclear how Team Flare could dynamically return for a "Z" version. Additionally, spotlighting only the Legendary Pokémon Zygarde risked feeling too similar to previous third versions centered on a single Legendary like Platinum. The resolved plotlines limited new narrative potential confined to Kalos alone.
### **Black 2 and White 2 Set a Precedent for True Sequels** 
The direct sequels of Black 2 and White 2, set two years after the originals, were hugely popular indicating fans welcomed this approach. Their sales surpassed even some primary paired versions. This success implied to Nintendo that fans may prefer a full new adventure over a third standalone remaster. However, developing a true Kalos sequel required inventing a new evil team and plots, which Nintendo likely didn't have durable ideas for at the time.
### **Limitations of Remixing X & Y Around Zygarde**
A Pokémon Z focusing only on more Zygarde content would have mirrored other third versions that expanded on a single Legendary like Platinum did with Arceus. While fulfilling the expected "Z" addition, it may not have provided enough novelty to entice those who already completed X & Y. Fans would likely demand substantive new storylines, not just more Zygarde spots on the map. 
### **Kalos' Untapped Potential for Expansion**
Compared to other regions with vast uncharted lands like Sinnoh, Kalos felt finished at the games' conclusion with limited unexplored areas hinted at. This constrained opportunities for genuinely new storylines or substantial world-building additions in a third Kalos game. Maintaining focus in Kalos risked confining the franchise when other regions offered more possibilities for new adventures and mechanics.
### **The Benefits of Moving On from Kalos**  
While some fans argued a Pokémon Z could have wrapped up lingering Kalos plotlines, lingering too long may have prevented new innovations. Remaining fixated on Kalos risked treading too similarly to Generation 6 titles fans found incomplete. By shifting focus to Hoenn and future regions like Alola, the series maintained momentum to explore fresh gameplay mechanics and territories. This allowed Pokémon to look to both its history and future simultaneously to keep the franchise endlessly captivating legions of fans.
### **Kalos Remains an Unfinished Chapter, but Innovation Demanded Moving On**
Debate continues if a Pokémon Z could have concluded Kalos' stories. However, the region concluded most core plotlines and lacked space for genuinely new experiences. Clinging to Kalos risked stagnating against competitors. By honoring the past through remakes while pioneering the future, the Pokémon seriesremembered its roots while nurturing continual evolution. Though Kalos' book closed prematurely,sacrificing some closure enabled constant growth Nintendo knew fans and the franchise required.
