### Adding an Xbox gift card to your Microsoft account
Many Xbox gamers enjoy using Xbox gift cards to pay for subscriptions like **Xbox Live Gold**. To start using the funds on your gift card, you'll need to add it to your **Microsoft account**. Simply go to the "Payment & Billing" section on your account page and click "redeem a code or gift card". Then, enter the 25-digit gift card code found on the back of your Xbox gift card. Finally, confirm the addition of the gift card funds to your **Microsoft gift card balance**. Once redeemed this way, the funds are instantly available in your account to use towards eligible digital purchases and subscriptions through Xbox and Windows.

### Changing your payment method for Xbox Live Gold
Now that your gift card funds are deposited in your Microsoft account, you can designate them as your payment source for subscriptions like **Xbox Live Gold**. Navigate to the "Payment Options" page and select the link to modify your payment method for recurring subscriptions. A dropdown will display your available payment options, including any Microsoft gift card balance currently in your account.
### Selecting the gift card balance as your new payment method    
Simply choose your available Microsoft gift card balance amount from the list of payment methods. A confirmation window will appear stating this balance will now cover all upcoming **Xbox Live Gold** charges to your account on their regularly scheduled due dates. As long as the gift card balance has sufficient funds to cover the subscription cost, it will automatically use those funds each billing cycle instead of an alternate payment option like a credit card on file.
### Verifying the new payment method on your account
You can view the updated payment details on the "Payment Options" page. Here you'll see when your next **Xbox Live Gold** charge will occur and that it will deduct from your Microsoft gift card balance rather than charging a card. This confirms the gift card is now set as your primary payment source for maintaining an active subscription.
### Using gift card balances for other digital subscriptions
In addition to **Xbox Live Gold**, Microsoft gift cards can similarly pay for alternative gaming subscriptions available through Xbox. This includes **Xbox Game Pass**, which gives you access to over 100 high-quality games for a low monthly fee. Just as with Live Gold, add funds to your account with gift cards then designate the balance when modifying your payment method for Game Pass subscriptions on console or PC.
### Supplementing a balance with a credit card  
There may be times when your gift card funds don't fully cover an upcoming subscription charge. In these cases, you have the option to apply your balance towards the cost and then supplement the remainder with another payment method like a credit card on file. For example, if you have $5 left on a gift card towards a $10 Xbox Live Gold renewal, it would use the $5 and then charge your credit card for the additional $5 still owed.
### Buying gift cards online
Fortunately, purchasing new Xbox gift cards is quite convenient thanks to availability both online and in stores. You can find physical and digital gift cards for sale through major retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart. Or, buy directly from Microsoft by visiting their online store. Once obtained, gift cards provide Xbox gamers a cost-effective means to manage recurring subscription fees.
### Checking gift card balances on console  
In addition to verifying funds on your Microsoft account online, it's also possible to check your available Xbox gift card balance directly from your Xbox console. Simply navigate to the "Settings" then "Account" area. Under payment options, the current amount of any Microsoft gift card balance associated with your gamertag will display. This allows gamers to confirm funds are available before making digital content purchases or renewing subscriptions via the console.
### Frequently asked gift card questions  
Some common inquiries involve the expiration periods for unused gift card balances as well as regional restrictions. According to Microsoft support, any gift card amounts you add to your Microsoft account remain available for redemption indefinitely. However,physical cards sold in retail locations typically feature expiration dates printed on them. Additionally, while gift cards can be purchased and redeemed worldwide, the available digital content and services may vary by region due to licensing constraints.
