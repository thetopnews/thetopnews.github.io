### Transferring Your Digital Game Library Automatically 
If you have purchased games digitally through the PlayStation store, your entire digital game library will transfer automatically to your new PS5 console through your PlayStation Network (PSN) account. **When you sign in to your PSN account on the PS5 for the first time**, all of your downloaded and purchased PS4 digital titles will be accessible to redownload at no additional cost. However, it is important to keep in mind that the PS5 has less storage space than the PS4, so do not simply redownload every game all at once. You will want to selectively choose the games you want to initially keep downloaded based on your available storage. The remaining games can still be redownloaded from your library as needed.

### Using Physical Discs to Access Your Game Library
For any PS4 titles you own on disc rather than digitally, you do not need to transfer anything - **simply inserting the disc into your PS5 will give you access to play that game**. The PS5 is fully backwards compatible with all PS4 games, whether digital or physical. This method avoids using up any additional storage space on the PS5 hard drive. Any game saves or progress are still stored on the PS5 hard drive rather than the disc itself, so this is only for accessing the games - save data will need to be transferred separately.
### Transferring Saves via Ethernet for a Wired Connection 
If you have both your PS4 and PS5 consoles available at the same time, Sony recommends connecting them with an Ethernet cable for the easiest method of transferring your saved game data. This allows for a fast, wired connection between the two consoles. With the consoles connected, you can select which saved data to copy or transfer directly from the PS4 to the PS5 storage through a few simple steps in the user interface. For those who have both consoles, this provides a seamless transfer without relying on cloud services or removable storage. 
### Uploading Saves to PlayStation Plus Cloud Storage
For those unable to connect both consoles simultaneously, a PlayStation Plus subscription enables uploading your saved game data from the PS4 to the cloud. With an active PS+ membership, go into Settings and select "Saved Data" then "Upload to Online Storage" to transfer your saves to the cloud. Then, on your PS5, sign into your PSN account and go to Settings > Saved Data and select "Download to Console Storage" to retrieve all those saved games you had previously uploaded. This allows preserving your progress even without direct access to both consoles at the same time. Just keep in mind the process requires an active PS+ membership.
### Using the Internal PS4 Hard Drive in an External Enclosure
For those looking to avoid streaming saves or using precious PS5 hard drive space, it is possible to directly transfer larger game files and saves by removing the internal hard drive from the PS4. Purchase an external hard drive enclosure compatible with 2.5 inch SATA hard drives, then install the PS4 hard drive into the enclosure. This converted external hard drive can then connect to the PS5 via USB and allow full access to copied games, applications, and most importantly - all of that saved game data. The process avoids relying on network connections and preserves more storage space natively on the PS5.
### Transferring via External USB Drive 
Another option that saves both network usage and PS5 internal storage is to copy PS4 games and saves to an external USB 3.0 or faster portable hard drive. With a large capacity external USB hard drive connected to the PS4, select the option in Settings to copy game files, saved data, and entire system software over to the drive. Once complete, connect that same external hard drive to one of the PS5's USB ports. The system will then recognize the transferred files and allow installation or copying of the saved games back over to PS5 internal storage. This self-contained method gets around using precious internal space or streaming large files over a home network.
### App and Game Compatibility Considerations
While transferring PS4 content helps preserve your investment in that console's games, it is important to keep in mind that not all PS4 games or applications will be compatible when run on PS5 hardware. Some may encounter bugs, graphical issues or simply may not run at all. It is always recommended to check the individual product pages for any transferred game to see if it is denoted as "PS5 backwards compatible" before expecting full functionality. Many titles will work perfectly fine through backwards compatibility, but there are no guarantees for full performance on every single PS4 game. Being aware of potential compatibility problems ahead of time avoids frustration later on. 
### Summary of Transfer Options
In summary, the PS5 offers several ways to carry your PS4 digital and physical games forward without requiring the older console still be hooked up. Digital libraries simply sign in as normal, while discs can get right to playing. Save data has options for direct console connection, cloud backup, or external drive methods. For larger files like full games, an external drive attached to either console provides a self-contained transfer. While backwards compatibility handles many titles, check individual games for potential issues. With a little planning to choose the best fit transfer method, your PS4 experience can seamlessly continue on PS5 hardware.
### Continuing Your Gaming Journey
Whether just upgrading for more powerful hardware or leaving the PS4 behind for good, the PS5 provides options to take your game library and progress with you. Moving forward, new experiences will continue to be created with the more advanced capabilities of Sony's latest console. But those years invested in PS4 gaming do not have to be left behind either. With some simple setup and transfers, the PS5 allows honoring those past adventures while exploration begins anew with powerful gameplay that can now be fully enjoyed in stunningly realistic 4K resolution at high frame rates. Your gaming journey can carry on seamlessly from PS4 to PS5.
