### **Supply Gluts Help Lower SSD Costs for Consumers**
As 2022 comes to a close, manufacturers are still left with overstocked inventories of critical NAND flash memory components due to the global chip shortage. While production of other components like CPUs and GPUs have not kept pace with continued strong demand, SSD makers like Samsung have more NAND than they can currently use. To clear out storage and make room for newer products, SSD list prices have been cut by up to 60% or more from early 2021 levels across several leading brands and popular models. With analysts predicting industry inventories may not stabilize until late 2023 or beyond, value-minded consumers have a unique opportunity to purchase high-performing drives at historically low prices.

### **The Samsung 980 Pro Drops Below $120 for a Whopping 2TB Capacity** 
One of the top performing NVMe Gen4 SSDs suffering the steepest discounts has been the Samsung 980 Pro. Initially launching in late 2020 for around $300, the 980 Pro 2TB model can now be found online for under $120, over 60% lower than a year ago. At up to 7,000 MB/s sequential read speeds, this drive delivers speeds sufficient for today's demanding workloads like 4K video editing as well as intense modern games. Its lightning-fast performance also makes multi-tasking and opening large files feel seamless on Windows and MacOS computers. For mainstream users seeking huge capacity without breaking the bank, the 980 Pro provides excellent performance and value.
### **The 990 Pro Matches its Predecessor on Features While Undercutting Price**
If you want the absolute latest in Gen4 technology but don't need the extra dollar or two performance, Samsung's slimmer 990 Pro NVMe SSD deserves a look. Now just over six months since its launch, the 990 Pro 2TB has seen an average discount of more than 50% off MSRP and routinely sells for around $150 or less. This represents savings of several hundred dollars compared to when it was new, despite fully supporting the latest PCIe 4.0 interface. Like the 980 Pro, the 990 Pro easily saturates SATA 6Gb/s speeds of most desktops and laptops while boosting loading and copying of massive files. At current depressed pricing, its combination of capacity, performance and endurance make it an incredible value.
### **Analysts Predict SSD Price Declines to Last Throughout Most of 2023**  
Various market trackers and Intel all foresee the global SSD oversupply situation persisting into at least the second half of 2023 according to their latest forecasts. With demand from server cloud providers and PC manufacturers leveling off from the work-from-home boom, distributors are reducing dealer pricing more aggressively to offload inventory. At the same time, the NAND market is expected to remain oversupplied until late next year as new fabs increase production. Unless geopolitical unrest or a recession curb demand significantly, prices on leading gaming and prosumer SSD models could continue easing until late 2023. This provides a window of 12-18 months for savvy buyers to stock up on high quality SSD upgrades and builds at uncharacteristically inexpensive rates.
### **Consoles, Laptops and Portables Benefit from Expanding Storage**  
With most video game consoles, thin-and-light laptops and portable handheld PCs now accommodating multiple M.2 NVMe SSDs, internal storage capacity demands have risen sharply across diverse product segments. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S still sell out instantly despite near two-year availability yet neither ships with more than a **665GB-1TB** of usable space out of the box. Laptop and 2-in-1 makers cram ever more capable components into shrinking footprints, accentuating the need for **expandable high-speed memory**. Low-cost SSD additions breathe new life into older systems too. Sub-$100 drives that double or quadruple base capacity have become very attainable with ongoing discounts. Affordable yet adept upgrades translate to speedier loading across more personas and titles than ever before.
### **PS5 Supply Remains Tight But Prices Steady as Production Falls Behind**
Despite launching in November 2020, new stock of the PlayStation 5 continues selling out within minutes of availability at all major retailers. Sony is simply unable to manufacture consoles fast enough to satisfy unprecedented interest, projecting it could take until late 2023 until supply finally exceeds demand. Unless output can significantly accelerate, it appears shortages may persist throughout much of this year. As a result, there seems little chance of price cuts any time soon considering the console remains one of the most desired yet difficult to acquire products worldwide. Gamers hoping to secure a PS5 this holiday season will need to vigilantly monitor restocks and move fast once inventory appears. Barring a production boost, availability headaches may unfortunately stretch on for much of 2023 too.
### **Hard Disk Drives Remain Obsolete for Serious Gaming** 
Mechanical hard disk drives had served PC gamers capably for decades, regularly exceeding one terabyte capacities at affordable prices. But their days as the go-to storage solution ended after SSD performance took off several years ago. Where HDDs topped 100-150 MB/s average speeds, today’s midrange NVMe SSDs do five to ten times better. This makes a night-and-day difference for modern titles with gigantic file sizes and constantly streaming high-fidelity textures. Loading a level in under 30 seconds instead of two full minutes enhances immersion considerably. Likewise, minimal load stutters and snappier applications are par for the course on even budget NVMe storage now. With prices for reputable 1TB SSDs similarly affordable as large HDDs, hard drives today are passé outside very low-budget builds or seldom-used archive PCs.
### **Stock Up on Reliable SSD Storage Before Prices Rise Again**   
Discerning PC builders can deduce underlying trends pointing to eventual price recovery on popular memory technologies like 3D NAND flash. When gluts resolve as expected sometime in 2024 coupled with usual annual module cost hikes, list prices on even mainstream Phison and Silicon Motion based M.2 SSDs might creep up 5-10% per quarter. To guarantee the ability to expand or upgrade systems affordably years into the future, forward-thinking upgraders can lock in capacity today while current going rates sit among the lowest ever seen. Accumulating a small inventory of drives from top tier makers like Samsung, Western Digital and Crucial provides dependable performance at savings that may evaporate after this unprecedented multi-year price plunge concludes. 
### **Expanded Cloud Gaming Role May Offset Some Local Storage Needs**
One variable that could disrupt assumptions around sustaining insatiable demand growth for internal SSD upgrades is the evolving influence of cloud and streaming games services. Platforms like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce NOW allow playing titles through an internet connection instead of directly from a local device. Adoption continues advancing rapidly as low-latency 5G cellular networks become widespread and home internet upgrades to fiber. This means some games previously downloaded and stored on consoles or PCs might shift off-device, easing local capacity requirements to a degree over the long run. However, internet infrastructure quality still lags globally and cloud solutions face latency issues inhibiting responsiveness for many. Therefore local drives will likely stay dominant for the highest-fidelity gaming experiences through at least the mid-2020s according to market surveys.
