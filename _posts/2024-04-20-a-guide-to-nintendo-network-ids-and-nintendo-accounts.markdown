### Everything You Need to Know about Nintendo Account Systems  
With multiple Nintendo systems available, it can get confusing keeping track of your Nintendo Network ID (NNID) and Nintendo Account. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain the differences between these account systems, how to merge your NNID funds and rewards into your Nintendo Account, and tips for smooth network setup on your Nintendo devices.

#### What Are NNIDs and Nintendo Accounts?
The **Nintendo Network ID (NNID)** was originally created for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS systems to allow for online functions and purchases from the Nintendo eShop. An NNID is required specifically for the Wii U and 3DS ecosystems. 
The **Nintendo Account** is the newer, unified account system used across modern Nintendo devices like the Nintendo Switch and associated mobile games like **Super Mario Run**. In addition to allowing for purchases and online play, a Nintendo Account links your gaming profile and achievements across devices. You can also connect social media accounts and see suggested friends from other compatible Nintendo mobile titles.
#### NNIDs Are for Wii U and 3DS, Nintendo Accounts Are for Switch and Mobile
While the NNID was succeeded by the Nintendo Account for most use cases, it still serves an integral purpose for the Wii U and 3DS systems. NNIDs can only be used for making purchases and accessing online features on the Wii U and 3DS, as those systems predate the Nintendo Account rollout. 
The Nintendo Account, on the other hand, is required for the Nintendo Switch and associated mobile games. It provides a unified account and friend system that isn't available through NNIDs alone.
#### Merge Your NNID Funds into Your Nintendo Account 
One notable benefit of linking your NNID to your Nintendo Account is the ability to utilize any remaining funds in your NNID eShop wallet on any Nintendo device. If you have **Nintendo eShop credit** left over from digital purchases on the Wii U or 3DS, merging accounts will allow you to access that balance when shopping on the Nintendo Switch eShop or in mobile games.
#### Earn Rewards Across Systems with My Nintendo
The **My Nintendo** rewards program allows players to earn points for achievements and purchases that can be redeemed for digital prizes. By linking your NNID and Nintendo Account, all of your gameplay activities - whether on Switch, 3DS, Wii U, or mobile - will contribute to your total My Nintendo points. You can then redeem rewards on any compatible device.
#### How to Link Your NNID to Your Nintendo Account 
To link your accounts, first you need to have both a NNID for your Wii U/3DS and a Nintendo Account created. Then follow these steps:
1. Visit accounts.nintendo.com using a web browser on your computer or mobile device. 
2. Log into your existing Nintendo Account by entering your login email and password.
3. Click the link to associate a NNID. 
4. Enter the login details for your NNID when prompted. 
5. Agree to merge your accounts. 
This will combine your eShop balances and link your My Nintendo rewards activity. Be sure to use the same email address for both accounts for a seamless merge.
#### Benefits of Linking Your Accounts
By taking the steps to connect your NNID to your Nintendo Account, you open up significant benefits across your Nintendo ecosystem:
- Use any remaining funds from NNID digital purchases on Switch, mobile games, or future systems. 
- Earn My Nintendo points for gameplay on all systems and redeem rewards across devices with a single unified account.
- See friends and their activities all in one place, whether they primarily play on Switch, 3DS, mobile or a mix of systems. 
- Simplify account management with a single sign-on rather than needing separate logins for NNID and Nintendo Account services.
#### Tips for Network Setup on Nintendo Devices
While networking capabilities differ between systems, here are some tips that can help smooth setup:
- Nintendo publishes digital codes to **disable WiFi connectivity** on specific systems if lockout occurs due to failed connectivity attempts. 
- **Double check passwords** when inputting WiFi network credentials to avoid accidental mistypes that could trigger temporary access bans.
- Certain routers feature **WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)**, which allows instant one-touch connection to a network from a compatible device without entering a password.
Overall, taking the steps to consolidate NNID and Nintendo Account services provides a more unified online experience across the current and future Nintendo ecosystems. Be sure accounts are properly linked to gain access to shared balances and rewards.
