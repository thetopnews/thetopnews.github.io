### Planning Your Purchase with Gift Cards  
When **buying digital games on Xbox**, you have two main options - purchasing directly through your Xbox account or using **Microsoft gift cards**. Let's break down the pros and cons of each approach. **Buying directly** allows a seamless one-step purchase process without worrying if a gift card balance fully covers taxes and prices. However, your payment details are then stored on your Xbox account. **Redeeming gift cards** requires entering codes to add funds to your Microsoft wallet first. You have more flexibility budgeting across purchases as long as the balance remains.

### Checking Game Availability and Requirements
Not every game can be purchased solely with gift card credit. The Xbox digital storefront clearly indicates during checkout if a specific **title supports gift card redemption**. Some older games may still require a valid payment method on file in case the gift card balance falls short of fully covering mandatory **taxes or the purchase price**. Be sure to verify a game's payment options before adding it to your cart to avoid issues at checkout.
### Redeeming Xbox Gift Cards for Your Wallet
To take advantage of gift cards, you must first redeem codes through the online redemption process. Navigate to the designated page on **Xbox.com or the console storefront** to enter the unique code provided on the back of physical cards. Follow the straightforward on-screen prompts to credit the funds from that gift card to your **Microsoft account wallet balance**. Money added in this manner can now be used towards eligible digital games and content. 
### Initiating Purchases with Gift Card Funds
Once gift card credits populate your Microsoft wallet, you are ready to shop! Browse titles from the Xbox digital store available on consoles and Windows PCs. Simply start the checkout process for a desired game. The wallet balance will be deducted automatically if sufficient funds exist to cover the purchase. Any remaining balance rolls over to use towards future game downloads or add-ons too!
### Insufficient Balance Options 
There may be times when the gift card balance falls short of fully paying for a game. In these cases, Xbox will prompt asking to provide an alternative payment method to cover the difference. Double check your payment details or Microsoft wallet for adequate funds, otherwise the purchase cannot be finalized. Another option involves topping up the balance with additional gift cards until reaching the full game price plus any applicable taxes.
### State Sales Tax on Digital Downloads  
Do not forget to factor in potential sales tax when budgeting gift card funds for gaming purchases. Some US states require collectors of sales and use taxes on digital items sold online as well. The checkout process on Xbox will accurately calculate and add the correct tax rate based on the billing address associated with your Microsoft account. Having extra gift card credits available can prevent coming up short due to unplanned taxes.
### Advantages of Going Digital 
While gift cards offer flexibility, there are also significant perks enjoyed through buying games digitally versus physical discs. **Downloading games** to your console eliminates the need to manually swap discs when playing different titles. Plus your full library is permanently accessible anytime since games are tied exclusively to your Xbox account rather than physical media that could be misplaced. Gift cards provide a convenient funding method for steadily expanding your digital gaming collection!
