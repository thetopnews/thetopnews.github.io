### Introduction
Whether you're shifting consoles or want to make sure your hard-earned progress isn't lost, uploading saves to cloud storage is a smart practice for PS4 gamers. This comprehensive guide will cover everything you need to know about using PlayStation Plus cloud storage to backup and access your game saves across multiple systems.

## Part 1: Setting Up Automatic Game Save Backups with PlayStation Plus
One of the main benefits of a PlayStation Plus membership is access to cloud storage for game saves. With a few simple steps, you can configure your PS4 to automatically upload specific saves whenever you finish a gaming session. 
### Configuring Automatic Uploads
To enable automatic backups, go to Settings then select **Save Data (PS4) and Upload to Online Storage**. Here you will see a list of all games installed on your system along with options to toggle automatic uploads on or off individually. Make sure your PS4 is connected online, then simply toggle the switch to "On" next to any titles you want to sync progress for automatically in the background. 
### Choosing Compatible Games
Not every game fully supports uploads to cloud storage. Only select titles that officially indicate cross-play compatibility will show up in the automatic upload list. You can check a game's product page, instructions, or main title screen for "Online Storage" or "Cross-Save" badges to verify. Some popular franchises like **Fortnite, Destiny 2, and Rocket League** allow saving across devices. 
### Setting it and Forgetting it
Once enabled, your PS4 will silently sync your game saves to the cloud each time the system enters rest mode after you finish a compatible session. This completely automates regular backups so you never have to manually manage uploads again. Simply play as usual and your progress will be securely stored online.
## Part 2: Manually Uploading Game Saves 
For games without automatic integration or if you want to backup existing saves, it's simple to manually select and upload individual files to the cloud through your PS4 system settings.
### Finding Saved Game Data  
From the home screen, navigate to Settings then Application Saved Data Management. Select "Saved Data" from the left menu to view all saves currently stored locally on your console. 
### Selecting Specific Files
Browse through the list to pick out the game and save file you want to upload. Many titles will let you backup individual slots while some like multiplayer games backup your full profile data as one file. Tap or click on the desired save to open its options.
### Starting the Upload Process  
Once a file is highlighted, select "Upload to Online Storage" near the bottom of the screen. This will copy the selected save data to your virtual locker in the cloud. Sit back and let the progress bar run its course - file size and connection speed will determine completion time.
### Verifying Successful Uploads
Once finished, the save's status will update to reflect its new online backup. You can also check the cloud storage section to view all uploaded files and free up space on your console by deleting local copies if desired.
## Part 3: Transferring Saves Between Systems
If you're shifting to a new PS4 or want a friend to try out your progress, you have a local option for copying saves between consoles without an online connection. 
### Preparing Storage Devices
A USB drive or external hard drive is required, with enough free space to hold the specific game saves you need to transfer. Ensure it's formatted to work with the PS4.
### Copying Saves to Storage 
On your primary system, navigate to **Saved Data on USB Storage** within Application Saved Data Management. Select the saves and copy them over to the prepared drive. 
### Pasting Saves on Another System
With the drive inserted into the target PS4, go back into Application Saved Data Management and choose **Saved Data on USB Storage Device**. Here you can paste copied games data onto this console's storage.
### Limitations of Local Transfers
While convenient for console-to-console moves, locally transferred saves will not be backed up to the cloud unless individually uploaded afterward. PlayStation Plus cloud storage remains the only way to fully sync progress across m multiple systems.
## Part 4: Identifying Cross-Platform Compatible Games  
One important thing to check before trying to sync saves is whether a specific title officially supports cross-generation and cross-console functionality. Here are some ways to verify save compatibility:
### In-Game Badges and Messages
Many games will display icons or notifications within the main menu or loading screens stating their cross-play credentials. Look for indicators like **"Your progress syncs across platforms"** or **"Continue your adventure on other devices"**.
### Product Descriptions and Marketing
Booting up a new game? Carefully read through its online store description, packaging details, or developer website for confirmation of **cross-gen save support**. Larger studios often advertise this selling feature prominently. 
### Community Questions and Answers   
Unsure? Search forums and help pages for user questions already addressed. Official responses will confirm whether a particular game allows you to seamlessly **continue your journey on PS4, PS5 and beyond**.  
The key is only using cloud storage for saves that are definitively designed for cross-platform play. Manually checking compatibility up front avoids frustration later.
## Part 5: Downloading Game Saves From the Cloud
With your saves securely stored online, accessing them from another system is simple. Here are the basic steps:
### Sign Into Your PlayStation Account  
Boot up the new console and make sure your PSN profile is signed in. This links you to your virtual cloud locker of uploaded saves.
### Navigating to Saved Data in Online Storage
Find Application Saved Data Management in the settings menu. Select "Saved Data in Online Storage" to view game files backed up to the cloud. 
### Downloading Desired Game Saves
Browse for the compatible title and campaign you want to restore. Highlight the specific save slot and press the designated button to initiate download back to your console. 
### Monitor Progress and Play!
A status bar will track restore completion depending on file size over your network connection. Once finished, that game will detect the reloaded save data and you can seamlessly pick up where you left off.
### Regularly Manage Cloud Storage Space  
Over time, your allotted online space may fill up as more games are played. Don't forget to periodically review and delete older saves locally and in the cloud as needed to maintain optimal backup functionality.
## Part 6: Additional Tips for Save Management
### Back Up Important Manual Saves
While automatic backups are handy, manually copy any special milestone saves just in case. Delete them locally once uploaded to maintain storage.
### Transfer Saves Before Updating Games  
New patches could potentially break backward compatibility - copy data to the cloud or a drive before upgrading to ensure uninterrupted play.  
### Set Reminders to Check Cloud Storage Space 
Larger file games like open world RPGs can consume significant storage over time. Schedule occasional reviews and pruning to avoid bottlenecks.
### Consider an External Hard Drive for Extra Local Room
Massive open world or MMO saves can max out internal storage. Add supplemental space with affordable external drives for more copies of precious games data.
### Contact Support if Transfers Fail for Any Reason  
Rarely, uploads or downloads may inexplicably fail or get corrupted. Reach out to PlayStation customer care for troubleshooting help to resolve issues.
With a bit of due diligence understood moves can keep those hundreds of hours invested in your favorite games protected no matter where or how you play next. Always back up your progress - it may save a lot of frustrating re-leveling down the road.
